       "of the world. There can be no doubt that man’s introduction\n",
       "to electricity was brought about through the\n",
       "medium of the thunderstorm, and from very early times\n",
       "come down to us records of the terror inspired by thunder\n",
       "and lightning, and of the ways in which the ancients tried\n",
       "to account for the phenomena. Even to-day, although we\n",
       "know what lightning is and how it is produced, a severe\n",
       "thunderstorm fills us with a certain amount of awe, if not\n",
       "fear; and we can understand what a terrifying experience\n",
       "it must have been to the ancients, who had none of our\n",
       "knowledge.</p>\n",
       "<p>These early people had simple minds, and from our\n",
       "point of view they had little intelligence; but they possessed\n",
       "a great deal of curiosity. They were just as anxious to\n",
       "explain things as we are, and so they were not content\n",
       "until they had invented an explanation of lightning and\n",
       "thunder. Their favourite way of accounting for anything\n",
       "they did not understand was to make up a sort of romance\n",
       "about it. They believed that the heavens were inhabited\n",
       "by various gods, who showed their pleasure or anger by<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_2\">2</span>\n",
       "signs, and so they naturally concluded that thunder was\n",
       "the voice of angry gods, and lightning the weapon with\n",
       "which they struck down those who had displeased them.\n",
       "Prayers and sacrifices were therefore offered to the gods, in\n",
       "the hope of appeasing their wrath.</p>\n",
       "<p>Greek and Roman mythology contains many references\n",
       "to thunder and lightning. For instance, we read about\n",
       "the great god Zeus, who wielded thunder-bolts which had\n",
       "been forged in underground furnaces by the giant Cyclops.\n",
       "There was no doubt that the thunder-bolts were made in\n",
       "this way, because one only had to visit a volcano in order\n",
       "to see the smoke from the furnace, and hear the rumbling\n",
       "echo of the far-off hammering. Then we are told the\n",
       "tragic story of Phaeton, son of the Sun-god. This youth,\n",
       "like many others since his time, was daring and venturesome,\n",
       "and imagined that he could do things quite as well\n",
       "as his father. On one occasion he tried to drive his father’s\n",
       "chariot, and, as might have been expected, it got beyond\n",
       "his control, and came dangerously near the Earth. The\n",
       "land was scorched, the oceans were dried up, and the whole\n",
       "Earth was threatened with utter destruction. In order to\n",
       "prevent such a frightful catastrophe, Jupiter, the mighty\n",
       "lord of the heavens, hurled a thunder-bolt at Phaeton, and\n",
       "struck him from the chariot into the river Po. A whole\n",
       "book could be written about these ancient legends concerning\n",
       "the thunderstorm, but, interesting as they are, they\n",
       "have no scientific value, and many centuries were to elapse\n",
       "before the real nature of lightning was understood.</p>\n",
       "<p>In order to trace the first glimmerings of electrical\n",
       "knowledge we must leave the thunderstorm and pass on to\n",
       "more trivial matters. On certain sea-coasts the ancients\n",
       "found a transparent yellow substance capable of taking a\n",
       "high polish, and much to be desired as an ornament; and\n",
       "about 600 years <span class=\"allsmcap\">B.C.</span> it was discovered that this substance,<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_3\">3</span>\n",
       "when rubbed, gained the power of drawing to it bits of\n",
       "straw, feathers, and other light bodies. This discovery is\n",
       "generally credited to a Greek philosopher named Thales,\n",
       "941–563 <span class=\"allsmcap\">B.C.</span>, and it must be regarded as the first step\n",
       "towards the foundation of electrical science. The yellow\n",
       "substance was amber. We now know it to be simply a\n",
       "sort of fossilized resin, but the Greeks gave it a much more\n",
       "romantic origin. When Phaeton’s rashness brought him\n",
       "to an untimely end, his sorrowing sisters, the Heliades,\n",
       "were changed into poplar trees, and their tears into amber.\n",
       "Amongst the names given to the Sun-god was Alector,\n",
       "which means the shining one, and so the tears of the\n",
       "Heliades came to have the name Electron, or the shining\n",
       "thing. Unlike most of the old legends, this story of the\n",
       "fate of the Sun-maidens is of great importance to us, for\n",
       "from the word “electron” we get the name Electricity.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thales and his contemporaries seem to have made no\n",
       "serious attempts to explain the attraction of the rubbed\n",
       "amber, and indeed so little importance was attached to the\n",
       "discovery that it was completely forgotten. About 321 <span class=\"allsmcap\">B.C.</span>\n",
       "one Theophrastus found that a certain mineral called\n",
       "“lyncurium” gained attractive powers when rubbed, but\n",
       "again little attention was paid to the matter, and astonishing\n",
       "as it may seem, no further progress worth mention was\n",
       "made until towards the close of the sixteenth century, when\n",
       "Doctor Gilbert of Colchester began to experiment seriously.\n",
       "This man was born about 1543, and took his degree of\n",
       "doctor of medicine at Cambridge in 1569. He was very\n",
       "successful in his medical work, and became President of the\n",
       "College of Physicians, and later on physician to Queen\n",
       "Elizabeth. He had a true instinct for scientific research,\n",
       "and was not content to accept statements on the authority\n",
       "of others, but tested everything for himself. He found\n",
       "that sulphur, resin, sealing-wax, and many other substances<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_4\">4</span>\n",
       "behaved like amber when rubbed, but he failed to get any\n",
       "results from certain other substances, such as the metals.\n",
       "He therefore called the former substances “electrics,” and\n",
       "the latter “anelectrics,” or non-electrics. His researches\n",
       "were continued by other investigators, and from him dates\n",
       "the science of electricity.</p>\n",

       "<p>Leaving historical matters for the present, we will\n",

       "as the result of rubbing. Amber is not always obtainable,\n",
       "and so we will use in its place a glass\n",
       "rod and a stick of sealing-wax. If the\n",
       "glass rod is rubbed briskly with a dry\n",
       "silk handkerchief, and then held close\n",
       "to a number of very small bits of paper,\n",

       "stick of sealing-wax is substituted for\n",
       "the glass. This power of attraction is\n",

       "the glass. If the experiment is repeated with a suspended\n",

       "ball, but there must be some difference between them as\n",
       "we get attraction in one case and repulsion in the other.</p>\n",
       "<p>The explanation is that the electric charges on the silk-rubbed\n",
       "glass and on the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax are of\n",
       "different kinds, the former being called positive, and the\n",
       "latter negative. Bodies with similar charges, such as the\n",
       "two glass rods, repel one another; while bodies with unlike\n",
       "charges, such as the glass and the sealing-wax, attract each\n",
       "other. We can now see why the pith ball was first\n",
       "attracted and then repelled. To start with, the ball was\n",
       "not electrified, and was attracted when the rubbed glass or\n",
       "sealing-wax was brought near it. When however the\n",
       "ball touched the electrified body it received a share of the\n",
       "latter’s electricity, and as similar charges repel one another,\n",
       "the ball was driven away.</p>\n",
       "<p>The kind of electricity produced depends not only on\n",
       "the substance rubbed, but also on the material used as the\n",
       "rubber. For instance, we can give glass a negative charge\n",
       "by rubbing it with flannel, and sealing-wax becomes\n",
       "positively charged when rubbed with silk. The important\n",
       "point to remember is that there are only two kinds of\n",
       "electricity, and that every substance electrified by rubbing\n",
       "is charged either positively, like the silk-rubbed glass, or\n",
       "negatively, like the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax.</p>\n",
       "<p>If we try to electrify a metal rod by holding it in the\n",
       "hand and rubbing it, we get no result, but if we fasten to<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_6\">6</span>\n",
       "the metal a handle of glass, and hold it by this while\n",
       "rubbing, we find that it becomes electrified in the same way\n",
       "as the glass rod or the sealing-wax. Substances such as\n",
       "glass do not allow electricity to pass along them, so that in\n",
       "rubbing a glass rod the part rubbed becomes charged, and\n",
       "the electricity stays there, being unable to spread to the\n",
       "other parts of the rod. Substances such as metals allow\n",
       "electricity to pass easily, so that when a metal rod is\n",
       "rubbed electricity is produced, but it immediately spreads\n",
       "over the whole rod, reaches the hand, and escapes. If we\n",
       "wish the metal to retain its charge we must provide it with\n",
       "a handle of glass or of some other material which does not\n",
       "allow electricity to pass. Dr. Gilbert did not know this,\n",
       "and so he came to the conclusion that metals were non-electrics,\n",
       "or could not be electrified.</p>\n",
       "<p>Substances which allow electricity to pass freely are\n",
       "called conductors, and those which do not are called non-conductors;\n",
       "while between the two extremes are many\n",
       "substances which are called partial conductors. It may be\n",
       "said here that no substance is quite perfect in either respect,\n",
       "for all conductors offer some resistance to the passage of\n",
       "electricity, while all non-conductors possess some conducting\n",
       "power. Amongst conductors are metals, acids, water,\n",
       "and the human body; cotton, linen, and paper are partial\n",
       "conductors; and air, resin, silk, glass, sealing-wax, and\n",
       "gutta-percha are non-conductors. When a conductor is\n",
       "guarded by a non-conductor so that its electricity cannot\n",
       "escape, it is said to be insulated, from Latin, <i lang=\"la\">insula</i>, an\n",
       "island; and non-conductors are also called “insulators.”</p>\n",
       "<p>So far we have mentioned only the electric charge\n",
       "produced on the substance rubbed, but the material used as\n",
       "rubber also becomes electrified. The two charges, however,\n",
       "are not alike, but one is always positive and the other\n",
       "negative. For instance, if glass is rubbed with silk, the<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_7\">7</span>\n",
       "glass receives a positive, and the silk a negative charge.\n",
       "It also can be shown that the two opposite charges are\n",
       "always equal in quantity.</p>\n",
       "<p>The two kinds of electricity are generally represented\n",
       "by the signs + and -, the former standing for positive\n",
       "and the latter for negative electricity.</p>\n",
       "<p>The electricity produced by rubbing, or friction, is\n",
       "known as Static Electricity; that is, electricity in a state of\n",
       "rest, as distinguished from electricity in motion, or current\n",
       "electricity. The word static is derived from a Greek word\n",
       "meaning to stand. At the same time it must be understood\n",
       "that this electricity of friction is at rest only in the\n",
       "sense that it is a prisoner, unable to move. When we\n",
       "produce a charge of static electricity on a glass rod, by\n",
       "rubbing it, the electricity would escape fast enough if it\n",
       "could. It has only two possible ways of escape, along the\n",
       "rod and through the air, and as both glass and air are non-conductors\n",
       "it is obliged to remain at rest where it was\n",
       "produced. On the other hand, as we have seen, the\n",
       "electricity produced by rubbing a metal rod which is not\n",
       "protected by an insulating handle escapes instantly, because\n",
       "the metal is a good conductor.</p>\n",
       "<p>When static electricity collects in sufficient quantities\n",
       "it discharges itself in the form of a bright spark, and we\n",
       "shall speak of these sparks in <a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#chapter_III\">Chapter III</a>. Static electricity\n",
       "is of no use for doing useful work, such as ringing bells or\n",
       "driving motors, and in fact, except for scientific purposes,\n",
       "it is more of a nuisance than a help. It collects almost\n",
       "everywhere, and its power of attraction makes it very\n",
       "troublesome at times. In the processes of textile manufacture\n",
       "static electricity is produced in considerable\n",
       "quantities, and it makes its presence known by causing the\n",
       "threads to stick together in the most annoying fashion. In\n",

       "<p>Curiously enough, static electricity has been detected in\n",

       "resemblances appeared to him so striking that he was\n",

       "put the matter to the test. For this purpose he hit upon\n",

       "made in 1878 by Gaston Planté. The electrodes were two\n",
       "strips of sheet lead placed one upon the other, but separated\n",
       "by some insulating material, and made into a roll. This\n",
       "roll was placed in dilute sulphuric acid, and one strip or\n",
       "plate connected to the positive, and the other to the\n",
       "negative terminal of the source of current. The current\n",
       "was passed for a certain length of time, and then the accumulator\n",
       "partly discharged; after which current was passed\n",
       "again, but in the reverse direction, followed by another period\n",
       "of discharge. This process, which is called <em>forming</em>,\n",
       "was continued for several days, and its effect was to change\n",
       "one plate into a spongy condition, and to form a coating\n",
       "of peroxide of lead on the other. When the plates were\n",
       "properly formed the accumulator was ready to be fully\n",
       "charged and put into use. The effect of charging was to\n",
       "rob one plate of its oxygen, and to transfer this oxygen to\n",
       "the other plate, which thus received an overcharge of the\n",
       "gas. During the discharge of the accumulator the excess\n",
       "of oxygen went back to the place from which it had been\n",
       "taken, and the current continued until the surfaces of both<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_41\">41</span>\n",
       "plates were reduced to a chemically inactive state. The\n",
       "accumulator could be charged and discharged over and\n",
       "over again as long as the plates remained in good order.</p>\n",
       "<p>In 1881, Faure hit upon the idea of coating the plates\n",
       "with a paste of red-lead, and this greatly shortened the\n",
       "time of forming. At first it was found difficult to make the\n",
       "paste stick to the plates, but this trouble was got rid of by\n",
       "making the plates in the form of grids, and pressing the\n",
       "paste into the perforations. Many further improvements\n",
       "have been made from time to time, but instead of tracing\n",
       "these we will go on at once to the description of a present-day\n",
       "accumulator. There are now many excellent accumulators\n",
       "made, but we have not space to consider more than\n",
       "one, and we will select that known as the “Chloride”\n",
       "accumulator.</p>\n",
       "<p>The positive plate of this accumulator is of the Planté\n",
       "type, but it is not simply a casting of pure lead, but is made\n",
       "by a building-up process which allows of the use of a\n",
       "lead-antimony mixture for the grids. This gives greater\n",
       "strength, and the grids themselves are unaffected by the\n",
       "chemical changes which take place during the charging and\n",
       "discharging of the cell. The active material, that is the\n",
       "material which undergoes chemical change, is pure lead\n",
       "tape coiled up into rosettes, which are so designed that the\n",
       "acid can circulate through the plates. These rosettes are\n",
       "driven into the perforations of the grid by a hydraulic press,\n",
       "and during the process of forming they expand and thus\n",
       "become very firmly fixed. The negative plate has a frame\n",
       "made in two parts, which are riveted together after the\n",
       "insertion of the active material, which is thus contained in\n",
       "a number of small cages. The plate is covered outside\n",
       "with a finely perforated sheet of lead, which prevents the\n",
       "active material from falling out. It is of the utmost\n",
       "importance that the positive and negative plates should be<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_42\">42</span>\n",
       "kept apart when in the cell, and in the Chloride accumulator\n",
       "this is ensured by the use of a patent separator made of\n",
       "a thin sheet of wood the size of the plates. Before being\n",
       "used the wood undergoes a special treatment to remove all\n",
       "substances which might be harmful, and it then remains\n",
       "unchanged either in appearance or composition. Other\n",
       "insulating substances, such as glass rods or ebonite forks,\n",
       "can be used as separators, but it is claimed that the wood\n",
       "separator is not only more satisfactory, but that in some\n",
       "unexplained way it actually helps to keep up the capacity\n",
       "of the cell. The plates are placed in glass, or lead-lined\n",
       "wood or metal boxes, and are suspended from above the\n",
       "dilute sulphuric acid with which the cells are filled. A\n",
       "space is left below the plates for the sediment which\n",
       "accumulates during the working of the cell.</p>\n",
       "<p>In all but the smallest cells several pairs of plates are\n",
       "used, all the positive plates being connected together and\n",

       "very large plates, on the principle of connecting in parallel,\n",
       "spoken of in <a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#chapter_IV\">Chapter IV</a>. A single cell, of whatever size,\n",

       "north magnetic pole of the earth?” This apparent difficulty\n",
       "is caused by a confusion in terms. If the Earth’s\n",
       "north magnetic pole really has north magnetism, then the\n",
       "north-pointing end of a magnet must be a south pole; and\n",
       "on the other hand, if the north-pointing end of a magnet\n",
       "has north magnetism, then the Earth’s north magnetic pole\n",
       "must be really a south pole. It is a troublesome matter to\n",
       "settle, but it is now customary to regard the Earth’s north\n",

       "south magnetic pole as possessing north magnetism. In\n",

       "separately, and suspended side by side. A compound\n",
       "needle of this kind is very much more reliable than a\n",
       "single needle. The material of which the card is made\n",

       "be transparent, and it is often made of thin sheet mica;\n",
       "but if the light comes from above, the card is made of\n",
       "some opaque material, such as very stout paper. The\n",

       "iron, twelve or more inches in diameter.</p>\n",
       "<p>On account of the fact that the magnetic poles of the\n",

       "and the geographical meridian is called the <em>declination</em>.\n",
       "The discovery that the declination varies in different parts\n",

       "made the first dynamo into a motor. There are many\n",
       "versions of this story, but the important point in all\n",

       "balancer on the positive side then acts as an electric motor,\n",
       "drives the balancer on the negative side as a dynamo, and\n",
       "thus provides the current required to raise the voltage on\n",
       "the negative side until the balance is restored. The working\n",
       "of the balancers, which need not be described in further\n",
       "detail, is practically automatic. Electric motors, for driving\n",

       "tramcar looks like a relic of prehistoric times, and\n",

       "<p>There are three distinct electric tramway systems; the\n",
       "trolley or overhead system, the surface contact system,\n",
       "and the conduit system. The trolley system has almost\n",
       "driven the other two from the field, and it is used almost<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_84\">84</span>\n",
       "exclusively throughout Great Britain and Ireland. On the\n",
       "Continent and in the United States the conduit system still\n",
       "survives, but probably it will not be long before the trolley\n",
       "system is universally employed.</p>\n",
       "<p>The superiority of the trolley system lies in the fact that\n",
       "it is cheaper to construct and to maintain than the other\n",
       "two, and also in its much greater reliability under all\n",
       "working conditions. The overhead wire is not one continuous\n",
       "cable, but is divided into sections of about half a\n",
       "mile in length, each section being supplied with current\n",
       "from a separate main. At each point where the current\n",
       "is fed to the trolley wire a sort of metal box may be seen\n",
       "at the side of the street. These boxes are called “feeder\n",
       "pillars,” and each contains a switch by means of which the\n",
       "current can be cut off from that particular section, for\n",
       "repairing or other purposes. Above the car is fixed an arm\n",
       "provided with a trolley wheel which runs along the wire,\n",
       "and this wheel takes the current from the wire. From the\n",
       "wheel the current passes down the trolley arm to the\n",
       "controller, which is operated by the driver, and from there\n",
       "to the motors beneath the car. Leaving the motors it\n",
       "passes to the wheels and then to the rails, from which it\n",
       "is led off at intervals by cables and so returned to the\n",
       "generating station. The current carried by the rails is at\n",
       "a pressure of only a few volts, so that there is not the\n",
       "slightest danger of shock from them. There are generally\n",
       "two electric motors beneath the car, and the horse-power\n",
       "of each varies from about fifteen to twenty-five.</p>\n",
       "<p>The controller consists mainly of a number of graduated\n",
       "resistances. To start the car the driver moves a handle\n",
       "forward notch by notch, thus gradually cutting out the\n",
       "resistance, and so the motors receive more and more\n",
       "current until they are running at full speed. The movement\n",
       "of the controller handle also alters the connexion of<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_85\">85</span>\n",
       "the motors. When the car is started the motors are\n",
       "connected in series, so that the full current passes through\n",
       "each, while the pressure is divided between them; but\n",
       "when the car is well on the move the controller connects\n",
       "the motors in parallel, so that each receives the full pressure\n",
       "of the current.</p>\n",
       "<p>The conduit and surface contact systems are much the\n",
       "same as the trolley system except in the method of supplying\n",

       "conductors conveying the current are placed in an underground\n",
       "channel or conduit of concrete strengthened by iron\n",
       "yokes. The top of the conduit is almost closed in so as to\n",
       "leave only a narrow slot, through which passes the current\n",
       "collector of the car. This current collector, or “plough” as\n",
       "it is called, carries two slippers which make contact with the\n",
       "conductors, and thus take current from them. In this\n",
       "system the current returns along one of the conductors, so\n",
       "that no current passes along the track rails. This is the\n",
       "most expensive of the three systems, both in construction\n",
       "and maintenance.</p>\n",

       "system in having conductors placed in a sort of underground\n",
       "trough, but in this case contact with the conductors\n",
       "is made by means of metal studs fixed at intervals in the\n",
       "middle of the track. The studs are really the tops of\n",
       "underground boxes each containing a switch, which, when\n",
       "drawn up to a certain position, connects the stud to the\n",
       "conductors. These switches are arranged to be moved by\n",
       "magnets fixed beneath the car, and thus when the car\n",
       "passes over a stud the magnets work the switch and connect\n",
       "the stud to the conductors, so that the stud is then\n",
       "“alive.” The current is taken from the studs by means of\n",
       "sliding brushes or skates which are carried by the car.\n",
       "The studs are thus alive only when the car is passing over<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_86\">86</span>\n",
       "them, and at all other times they are dead, and not in any\n",
       "way dangerous.</p>\n",
       "<p>The weight and speed of electric cars make it important\n",
       "to have a thoroughly reliable system of brakes. First of\n",
       "all there are ordinary mechanical brakes, which press\n",
       "against the wheels. Then there are electro-magnetic\n",
       "slipper brakes which press on the rails instead of on the\n",
       "wheels of the car. These brakes are operated by electro-magnets\n",
       "of great power, the current necessary to excite the\n",
       "magnets being taken from the motors. Finally there is\n",
       "a most interesting and ingenious method of regenerative\n",
       "control. Before a car can be stopped after it has attained\n",
       "considerable speed a certain amount of energy has to be\n",
       "got rid of in some way. With the ordinary mechanical or\n",
       "electro-magnetic brakes this energy is wasted, but in the\n",
       "regenerative method it is turned into electric current, which\n",
       "is sent back into the circuit. If an electric motor is supplied\n",
       "with mechanical power instead of electric current it becomes\n",
       "a dynamo, and generates current instead of using it. In\n",
       "the regenerative system, when a car is “coasting” down a\n",
       "hill it drives the wheels, and the wheels drive the motors,\n",

       "of the abnormal amount of current taken by a car in climbing\n",

       "where his brilliant lectures attracted large and enthusiastic\n",
       "audiences. He was an indefatigable experimenter, and in\n",

       "disposal a very large voltaic battery consisting of 2000\n",
       "cells. In 1802 he found that if two rods of carbon, one\n",
       "connected to each terminal of his great battery, were\n",
       "first made to touch one another and then gradually\n",
       "separated, a brilliant arch of light was formed between\n",
       "them. The intense brilliance of this electric arch, or <em>arc</em>\n",
       "as it came to be called, naturally suggested the possibility\n",
       "of utilizing Davy’s discovery for lighting purposes, but the\n",
       "maintaining of the necessary current proved a serious\n",
       "obstacle. The first cost of a battery of the required size\n",
       "was considerable, but this was a small matter compared\n",
       "with the expense of keeping the cells in good working\n",
       "order. Several very ingenious and more or less efficient\n",
       "arc lamps fed by battery current were produced by various\n",
       "inventors, but for the above reason they were of little use\n",
       "except for experimental purposes, and the commercial\n",
       "success of the arc lamp was an impossibility until the\n",

       "Since that time innumerable shapes and forms of arc lamps<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_94\">94</span>\n",

       "by leaps and bounds. To-day, wherever artificial\n",

       "Particles of carbon are torn off by the spark and volatilized,\n",
       "and these incandescent particles form a sort of bridge which\n",
       "is a sufficiently good conductor for the current to pass\n",
       "across it from one rod to the other. When the carbons\n",
       "are placed horizontally, the glowing mass is carried upwards\n",

       "lighting purposes carbon is found to be most suitable.</p>\n",
       "<p>Either continuous or alternating currents may be used\n",
       "to form the arc. With continuous current, if the carbon\n",

       "or less pointed. The fact that with continuous current the\n",
       "positive rod consumes away twice as fast as the negative\n",
       "rod, may be taken advantage of to decrease the cost of new\n",
       "carbons, by replacing the wasted positive rod with a new\n",

       "this kind of lighting the dazzling glare of the outdoor\n",

       "so methods of indirect lighting are employed to give a soft\n",
       "and pleasant light. Most of the light in the arc lamp comes\n",
       "from the positive carbon, and for ordinary outdoor lighting\n",
       "this carbon is placed above the negative carbon. In lamps\n",
       "for interior lighting the arrangement is frequently reversed,\n",
       "so that the positive carbon is below. Most of the light is\n",

       "of a white colour the rays are reflected by it, and a soft and\n",
       "evenly diffused lighting is the result. Some light comes\n",
       "also from the negative carbon, and those downward rays\n",
       "are reflected to the ceiling by a reflector placed beneath the\n",
       "lamp. Where the ceiling is very high or of an unsuitable\n",
       "colour, a sort of artificial ceiling in the shape of a large\n",

       "of the light is reflected to the ceiling, and part transmitted\n",
       "directly through a semi-transparent reflector below the\n",

       "the light and sends it out as a bundle of parallel\n",
       "rays, and the illuminating power is such that a good searchlight\n",
       "has a working range of nearly two miles in clear\n",

       "candle-power. For some purposes, such as the illuminating\n",
       "of narrow stretches of water, a wider beam is required, and\n",
       "this is obtained by a diverging lens placed in front of the\n",
       "arc. In passing through this lens the light is dispersed or\n",
       "spread out to a greater or less extent according to the\n",
       "nature of the lens. Searchlights are used in navigating\n",
       "the Suez Canal by night, for lighting up the buoys along\n",
       "the sides of the canal. The ordinary form of searchlight\n",

       "containing a small quantity of mercury. Platinum wires to\n",
       "take the current from the source of supply are sealed in at\n",
       "each end. The tube is attached to a light tubular framework\n",
       "of metal suspended from the ceiling, and this frame\n",
       "is arranged so that it can be tilted slightly downwards by<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_100\">100</span>\n",
       "pulling a chain. As shown in <a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#fig_22\">Fig. 22</a>, the normal position\n",
       "of the lamp is not quite horizontal, but tilted slightly downwards\n",
       "towards the end of the tube having the bulb containing\n",
       "the mercury. The platinum wire at this end dips\n",
       "into the mercury, so making a metallic contact with it.\n",
       "The lamp is lighted by switching on the current and pulling\n",
       "down the chain. The altered angle makes the mercury\n",
       "flow along the tube towards the other platinum electrode,\n",
       "and as soon as it touches this a conducting path for the\n",
       "current is formed from end to end of the tube. The lamp\n",
       "is now allowed to fall back to its original angle, so that the\n",
       "mercury returns to its bulb. There is now no metallic connexion\n",
       "between the electrodes, but the current continues\n",
       "to pass through the tube as a vacuum discharge. Some\n",
       "of the mercury is immediately vaporized and rendered\n",
       "brilliantly incandescent, and so the light is produced. The\n",
       "trouble of pulling down the chain is avoided in the\n",
       "automatic mercury vapour lamp, which is tilted by an\n",
       "electro-magnet. This magnet is automatically cut out of<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_101\">101</span>\n",
       "circuit as soon as the tilting is completed and the arc\n",
       "struck.</p>\n",
       "<p>The average length of the tube in the ordinary form of\n",
       "mercury vapour lamp is about 30 inches, and a light of\n",
       "from 500 to 3000 candle-power is produced, according to\n",
       "the current used. Another form, known as the “Silica”\n",
       "lamp, is enclosed in a globe like that of an ordinary electric\n",
       "arc lamp. The tube is only about 5 or 6 inches in\n",
       "length, and it is made of quartz instead of glass, the\n",
       "arrangements for automatically tilting the tube being\n",
       "similar to those in the ordinary form of lamp.</p>\n",
       "<p>The light of the mercury vapour lamp is different from\n",
       "that of all other lamps. Its peculiarity is that it contains\n",
       "practically no red rays, most of the light being yellow, with\n",
       "a certain proportion of green and blue. The result is a\n",
       "light of a peacock-blue colour. The absence of red rays\n",
       "alters colour-values greatly, scarlet objects appearing\n",
       "black; and on this account it is impossible to match colours\n",
       "by this light. In many respects, however, the deficiency\n",
       "in red rays is a great positive advantage. Every one who\n",
       "has worked by mercury vapour light must have noticed\n",
       "that it enables very fine details to be seen with remarkable\n",
       "distinctness. This property is due to an interesting fact.\n",
       "Daylight and ordinary artificial light is a compound or\n",
       "mixture of rays of different colours. It is a well-known\n",
       "optical fact that a simple lens is unable to bring all these\n",
       "rays to the same focus; so that if we sharply focus an image\n",
       "by red light, it is out of focus or blurred by blue light. This\n",
       "defect of the lens is called “chromatic aberration.” The\n",
       "eye too suffers from chromatic aberration, so that it cannot\n",
       "focus sharply all the different rays at the same time. The\n",
       "violet rays are brought to a focus considerably in front of\n",
       "the red rays, and the green and the yellow rays come in\n",
       "between the two. The eye therefore automatically and<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_102\">102</span>\n",
       "unconsciously effects a compromise, and focuses for the\n",
       "greenish-yellow rays. The mercury vapour light consists\n",
       "very largely of these rays, and consequently it enables the\n",
       "image to be focused with greater sharpness; or, in other\n",
       "words, it increases the acuteness of vision. Experiments\n",
       "carried out by Dr. Louis Bell and Dr. C. H. Williams\n",
       "demonstrated this increase in visual sharpness very conclusively.\n",
       "Type, all of exactly the same size, was examined\n",
       "by mercury vapour light, and by the light from an electric\n",
       "incandescent lamp with tungsten filament. The feeling of\n",
       "sharper definition produced by the mercury vapour light\n",
       "was so strong that many observers were certain that the\n",
       "type was larger, and they were convinced that it was\n",
       "exactly the same only after careful personal examination.</p>\n",
       "<p>Mercury vapour light apparently imposes less strain\n",
       "upon the eyes than ordinary artificial light, and this\n",
       "desirable feature is the result of the absence of the red rays,\n",
       "which, besides having little effect in producing vision, are\n",
       "tiring to the eyes on account of their heating action. The\n",
       "light is very highly actinic, and for this reason it is largely\n",
       "used for studio and other interior photographic work. In\n",
       "cases where true daylight colour effects are necessary, a\n",
       "special fluorescent reflector is used with the lamp. By\n",
       "transforming the frequency of the light waves, this reflector\n",
       "supplies the missing red and orange rays, the result being\n",
       "a light giving normal colour effects.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another interesting vapour lamp may be mentioned\n",
       "briefly. This has a highly exhausted glass tube containing\n",
       "neon, a rare gas discovered by Sir William Ramsay. The\n",
       "light of this lamp contains no blue rays, and it is of a\n",
       "striking red colour. Neon lamps are used chiefly for\n",
       "advertising purposes, and they are most effective for\n",
       "illuminated designs and announcements, the peculiar and\n",
       "distinctive colour of the light attracting the eye at once.</p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_103\">103</span></p>\n",
       "<p>An electric current meets with some resistance in\n",
       "passing through any substance, and if the substance is a\n",
       "bad conductor the resistance is very great. As the current\n",
       "forces its way through the resistance, heat is produced, and\n",
       "a very thin wire, which offers a high resistance, may be\n",
       "raised to a white heat by an electric current, and it then\n",
       "glows with a brilliant light. This fact forms the basis of\n",
       "the electric incandescent or glow lamp.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the year 1878, Thomas A. Edison set himself the\n",
       "task of producing a perfect electric incandescent lamp,\n",
       "which should be capable of superseding gas for household\n",
       "and other interior lighting. The first and the greatest\n",
       "difficulty was that of finding a substance which could be\n",
       "formed into a fine filament, and which could be kept\n",
       "in a state of incandescence without melting or burning\n",
       "away. Platinum was first chosen, on account of its very\n",
       "high melting-point, and the fact that it was not acted\n",
       "upon by the gases of the air. Edison’s earliest lamps\n",
       "consisted of a piece of very thin platinum wire in the\n",
       "shape of a spiral, and enclosed in a glass bulb from which\n",
       "the air was exhausted. The ends of the spiral were\n",
       "connected to outside wires sealed into the bulb. It was\n",
       "found, however, that keeping platinum continuously at a\n",
       "high temperature caused it to disintegrate slowly, so that\n",
       "the lamps had only a short life. Fine threads or filaments\n",
       "of carbon were then tried, and found to be much more\n",
       "durable, besides being a great deal cheaper. The carbon\n",
       "filament lamp quickly became a commercial success, and\n",
       "up to quite recent years it was the only form of electric\n",
       "incandescent lamp in general use.</p>\n",
       "<p>In 1903 a German scientist, Dr. Auer von Welsbach,\n",
       "of incandescent gas mantle fame, produced an electric lamp\n",
       "in which the filament was made of the metal osmium, and\n",
       "this was followed by a lamp using the metal tantalum for<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_104\">104</span>\n",
       "the filament, the invention of Siemens and Halske. For a\n",
       "while the tantalum lamp was very successful, but more\n",
       "recently it has been superseded in popularity by lamps\n",
       "having a filament of the metal tungsten. The success of\n",
       "these lamps has caused the carbon lamp to decline in\n",
       "favour. The metal filaments become incandescent much\n",
       "more easily than the carbon filament, and for the same\n",
       "candle-power the metal filament lamp consumes much less\n",
       "current than the carbon lamp.</p>\n",
       "<p>The construction of tungsten lamps is very interesting.\n",
       "Tungsten is a very brittle metal, and at first the lamps\n",
       "were fitted with a number of separate filaments. These\n",
       "were made by mixing tungsten powder with a sort of paste,\n",
       "and then squirting the mixture through very small\n",
       "apertures, so that it formed hair-like threads. Early in\n",
       "1911 lamps having a filament consisting of a single continuous\n",
       "piece of drawn tungsten wire were produced. It\n",
       "had been known for some time that although tungsten was\n",
       "so brittle at ordinary temperatures, it became quite soft\n",
       "and flexible when heated to incandescence in the lamp, and\n",
       "that it lost this quality again as soon as it cooled down.\n",
       "A process was discovered by which the metal could be\n",
       "made permanently ductile, by mechanical treatment while\n",
       "in the heated state. In this process pure tungsten powder\n",
       "is pressed into rods and then made coherent by heating.\n",
       "While still hot it is hammered, and finally drawn out into\n",
       "fine wires through diamond dies. The wire is no thicker\n",
       "than a fine hair, and it varies in size from about 0·012 mm.\n",
       "to about 0·375 mm., according to the amount of current it\n",
       "is intended to take. It is mounted by winding it continuously\n",
       "zigzag shape round a glass carrier, which has at\n",
       "the top and the bottom a number of metal supports\n",
       "arranged in the form of a star, and insulated by a central\n",
       "rod of glass. One star is made of strong, stiff material,<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_105\">105</span>\n",
       "and the other consists of fine wires of some refractory\n",
       "metal, molybdenum being used in the Osram lamps.\n",
       "These supports act as springs, and keep the wire securely\n",
       "in its original shape, no matter in what position the lamp\n",
       "is used. The whole is placed in a glass bulb, which is\n",
       "exhausted of air and sealed up.</p>\n",
       "<p>For some purposes lamps with specially small bulbs are\n",
       "required, and in these the tungsten wire is made in the\n",
       "shape of fine spirals, instead of in straight pieces, so that\n",
       "it takes up much less room. In the “Axial” lamp the\n",
       "spiral is mounted in such a position that most of the light\n",
       "is sent out in one particular direction.</p>\n",
       "<p>The latest development in electric incandescent lamps is\n",
       "the “half-watt” lamp. The watt is the standard of electrical\n",
       "energy, and it is the rate of work represented by a current\n",
       "of one ampere at a pressure of 1 volt. With continuous\n",
       "currents the watts are found very simply by multiplying\n",
       "together the volts and the amperes. For instance, a\n",
       "dynamo giving a current of 20 amperes at a pressure\n",
       "of 50 volts would be called a 1000-watt dynamo.\n",
       "With alternating currents the calculation is more complicated,\n",
       "but the final result is the same. The ordinary form\n",
       "of tungsten lamp gives about one candle-power for every\n",
       "watt, and is known as a one-watt lamp. As its name\n",
       "suggests, the half-watt lamp requires only half this amount\n",
       "of energy to give the same candle-power, so that it is very\n",
       "much more economical in current. In this lamp the\n",
       "tungsten filament is wound in a spiral, but instead of being\n",
       "placed in the usual exhausted bulb, it is sealed into a bulb\n",
       "containing nitrogen gas. The increased efficiency is\n",
       "obtained by running the filament at a temperature from\n",
       "400° to 600° C. higher than that at which the filament in\n",
       "the ordinary lamp is used.</p>\n",
       "<p>In spite of the great advances in artificial lighting<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_106\">106</span>\n",
       "made during recent years, no one has yet succeeded in\n",
       "producing light without heat. This heat is not wanted,\n",
       "and it represents so much waste energy. It has often been\n",
       "said that the glow-worm is the most expert of all illuminating\n",
       "engineers, for it has the power of producing at will a\n",
       "light which is absolutely without heat. Perhaps the nearest\n",
       "approach to light without heat is the so-called “cold light”\n",
       "invented by M. Dussaud, a French scientist. His device\n",
       "consists of a revolving ring of exactly similar tungsten\n",
       "lamps. Each of these lamps has current passed through it\n",
       "in turn, and the duration of the current in each is so short,\n",
       "being only a fraction of a second, that the lamp has not\n",
       "sufficient time to develop any appreciable amount of heat.\n",
       "The light from the ring of lamps is brought to a focus, and\n",
       "passed through a lens to wherever it is required. Electric\n",
       "incandescent lamps are made in a variety of sizes, each one\n",
       "being intended for a certain definite voltage. If a lamp\n",
       "designed for, say, 8 volts, is used on a circuit of\n",
       "32 volts, its candle-power is greatly increased, while the\n",
       "amount of current consumed is not increased in proportion.\n",
       "In this way the lamp becomes a more efficient source\n",
       "of light, but the “over-running,” as it is called, has a\n",
       "destructive effect on the filament, so that the life of the\n",
       "lamp is greatly shortened. In the Dussaud system however\n",
       "the time during which each lamp has current passing\n",
       "through it is so short, followed by a period of rest, that\n",
       "the destructive effect of over-running is reduced to the\n",
       "minimum; so that by using very high voltages an extremely\n",
       "brilliant light is safely obtained with a comparatively\n",
       "small consumption of current. It might be thought\n",
       "that the constant interchange of lamps would result in an\n",
       "unsteady effect, but the substitution of one lamp for another\n",
       "is carried out so rapidly that the eye gets the impression of\n",
       "perfect steadiness. The Dussaud system is of little use<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_107\">107</span>\n",
       "for ordinary lighting purposes, but for lighthouse illumination,\n",
       "photographic studio work, and the projection of\n",
       "lantern slides and cinematograph films, it appears to be of\n",
       "considerable value.</p>\n",
       "<p>Electric light has many advantages over all other\n",
       "illuminants. It gives off very little heat, and does not use\n",
       "up the oxygen in the air of a room as gas does; while by\n",
       "means of flexible wires the lamps can be put practically\n",
       "anywhere, so that the light may be had just where it is\n",
       "wanted. Another great advantage is that the light may be\n",

       "for lighting purposes, is a compound of calcium and\n",
       "carbon; it is made by raising a mixture of lime and coke\n",
       "to an intense heat in an electric furnace. The manufacture\n",
       "of calcium carbide is carried on on a very large scale at\n",
       "Niagara, with electric power obtained from the Falls, and\n",
       "at Odda in Norway, where the power is supplied by the\n",
       "river Tysse. Carborundum, a substance almost as hard\n",
       "as the diamond, is largely used for grinding and polishing\n",
       "purposes. It is manufactured by sending a strong current\n",
       "through a furnace containing a core of coke surrounded by\n",
       "a mixture of sand, sawdust, and carbon. The core becomes\n",
       "incandescent, and the heating is continued until the\n",
       "carbon combines with the sand, the process taking about\n",
       "a day. Graphite, a kind of carbon, occurs naturally in the\n",
       "form of plumbago, which is used for making black lead\n",

       "are already worked out, and others will be exhausted\n",
       "before long. By means of the electric furnace, graphite\n",
       "can now be made artificially, by heating anthracite\n",
       "coal, and at Niagara a quantity running into thousands\n",
       "of tons is produced every year. Electric furnaces are\n",

       "<p>For many years past a great deal of time and money\n",

       "Quite apart from its use in articles of jewellery, the\n",
       "diamond has many very important industrial applications,\n",
       "its value lying in its extreme hardness, which is not\n",
       "equalled by any other substance. The very high price\n",

       "experiments seem to show that electricity will solve the\n",
       "problem of diamond making. Small diamonds, one-tenth\n",
       "of an inch long, have been made in Paris by means of the\n",

       "for several hours. A black substance, something like coke,\n",
       "is formed round the negative carbon, and in this are found\n",
       "tiny diamonds. The diamonds continue to increase slowly\n",
       "in size during the time that the arc is at work, and it is estimated\n",
       "that they grow at the rate of about one-hundredth\n",
       "of an inch per hour. So far only small diamonds have<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_114\">114</span>\n",

       "joint is produced. The chief difficulty in welding is\n",
       "that of securing and keeping up the proper temperature,\n",
       "and some metals are much more troublesome than others\n",
       "in this respect. Platinum, iron, and steel are fairly easy to\n",
       "weld, but most of the other metals, and alloys of different\n",
       "metals, require very exact regulation of temperature. It\n",
       "is almost impossible to obtain this exact regulation by\n",
       "ordinary methods of heating, but the electric current makes\n",
       "it a comparatively easy matter. The principle of ordinary\n",
       "electric welding is very simple. The ends of the two\n",
       "pieces of metal are placed together, and a powerful current\n",
       "is passed through them. This current meets with a high\n",
       "resistance at the point of contact of the two pieces, and so\n",
       "heat is produced. When the proper welding temperature\n",
       "is reached, and the metal is in a sort of pasty condition,\n",
       "the two pieces are pressed strongly together, and the\n",
       "current is switched off. The pieces are now firmly united\n",
       "together. The process may be carried out by hand, the\n",
       "welding smith switching the current on and off, and applying\n",
       "pressure at the right moment by means of hydraulic\n",
       "power. There are also automatic welders, which perform\n",

       "<p>The actual mechanism varies considerably in different\n",
       "makes of clock. In one of the simplest arrangements there\n",
       "is a pendulum with an armature of soft iron fixed to the\n",
       "extremity of its bob. Below the pendulum is an electro-magnet,\n",
       "and this is supplied with current from a small\n",
       "battery of dry cells. A short piece of metal, called a “pallet,”\n",
       "is attached to the rod of the pendulum by means of a\n",
       "pivot; and as the pendulum swings it trails this pallet<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_125\">125</span>\n",
       "backwards and forwards along a horizontal spring. In this\n",
       "spring are cut two small notches, one on each side of the\n",

       "sufficiently vigorously, the pallet slides over these notches;\n",
       "but when the swing has diminished to a certain point the\n",
       "pallet catches in one or other of the notches. This has\n",
       "the effect of pressing down the spring so that it touches a\n",
       "contact piece just below, and the battery circuit is then\n",
       "completed. The electro-magnet now comes into action\n",
       "and attracts the armature, thus giving the pendulum a pull\n",
       "which sets it swinging vigorously again. The spring is\n",
       "then freed from the pressure of the pallet, and it rises to its\n",
       "original position, so that the circuit is broken. This puts\n",
       "out of action the electro-magnet, and the latter does no\n",
       "further work until the pendulum requires another pull.\n",
       "The movement of the pendulum drives the wheelwork,\n",

       "kind will run without attention for several months, and\n",
       "then the battery requires to be renewed. As time-keepers,\n",

       "an electric discharge could be transmitted to a considerable\n",
       "distance through a conducting substance such as a moistened\n",
       "thread or a wire, and this fact suggested the possibility of<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_129\">129</span>\n",
       "a method of electric signalling. In 1753 a writer in <cite>Scott’s\n",
       "Magazine</cite> brought forward an ingenious scheme based upon\n",
       "the attraction between an electrified body and any light\n",
       "substance. His telegraph was worked by an electric\n",

       "transmitting key at station A is pressed, the circuit is closed\n",
       "and a current flows along the single wire, and then divides\n",

       "through one coil and half the path through the other.\n",
       "Equal currents thus flow through the oppositely wound\n",
       "coils, and the needle at station A is not deflected. Leaving\n",
       "the coils, one of these equal currents flows away to earth,\n",

       "arrival at station B the current is able to pass through only\n",
       "one of the coils round the needle, and consequently the\n",
       "needle is deflected and the signal given. In this way the\n",
       "transmitting operator at station A is able to signal to station\n",
       "B without affecting the receiver at his own end, and\n",

       "Channel from Dover to Calais, in 1850. A single copper\n",
       "wire covered with a layer of gutta-percha half an inch thick\n",

       "it afterwards turned out that a Boulogne fisherman had\n",
       "hauled up the cable with his trawl. This line proved that\n",
       "telegraphic communication between England and France\n",
       "was possible, but the enterprise was assailed with every\n",
       "imaginable kind of abuse and ridicule. It is said that some\n",
       "people really believed that the cable was worked in the\n",
       "style of the old-fashioned house bell, and that the signals\n",
       "were given by pulling the wire! In the next year another\n",
       "attempt was made by Mr. T. R. Crampton, a prominent\n",
       "railway engineer, who himself contributed half of the\n",
       "£15,000 required. The form of cable adopted by him\n",
       "consisted of four copper wires, each covered with two layers\n",
       "of gutta-percha, and the four enclosed in a covering formed\n",
       "of ten galvanized iron wires wound spirally round them.<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_145\">145</span>\n",
       "The line proved a permanent success, and this type of\n",
       "cable, with certain modifications, is still in use. In 1852\n",
       "three attempts were made to connect England and Ireland,\n",
       "but the first two failed owing to the employment of cables\n",
       "too light to withstand the strong tidal currents, and the\n",
       "third was somehow mismanaged as regards the paying-out,\n",
       "so that there was not enough cable to reach across. A\n",
       "heavier cable was tried in the next year, and this was a\n",
       "lasting success.</p>\n",
       "<p>The success of these two cables led to the laying of\n",
       "many other European cables over similar distances, but we\n",
       "must now pass on to a very much bigger undertaking, the\n",
       "laying of the Atlantic cable. In 1856 the Atlantic Telegraph\n",

       "and working telegraphic communication between Ireland\n",

       "The objections launched against the scheme were of course\n",
       "many, some of them making very amusing reading. It is\n",

       "Professor Airy, then Astronomer Royal, seriously stating\n",
       "that it was a mathematical impossibility to submerge a\n",
       "cable safely to such depths, and that even if this could be\n",
       "done, messages could not be transmitted through such a\n",
       "great length of cable.</p>\n",
       "<p>It was estimated that a length of about 2500 nautical\n",
       "miles would be enough to allow for all contingencies, and\n",
       "the construction of the cable was commenced in February\n",
       "1857, and completed in June of that year. It is difficult to\n",
       "realize the gigantic nature of the task of making a cable of\n",
       "such dimensions. The length of copper wire used in<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_146\">146</span>\n",

       "sheathing took 367,500 miles of iron wire; the total length\n",
       "of wire used being enough to go round the Earth thirteen\n",
       "times. The cable was finally stowed away on board two\n",
       "warships, one British and the other American.</p>\n",
       "<p>The real troubles began with the laying of the cable.\n",
       "After landing the shore end in Valentia Bay, the paying-out\n",
       "commenced, but scarcely had five miles been laid when\n",
       "the cable caught in the paying-out machinery and parted.\n",
       "By tracing it from the shore the lost end was picked up\n",
       "and spliced, and the paying-out began again. Everything\n",
       "went well for two or three days, and then, after 380 miles\n",
       "had been laid, the cable snapped again, owing to some\n",
       "mismanagement of the brakes, and was lost at a depth of\n",
       "2000 fathoms. The cable had to be abandoned, and the\n",
       "ships returned to Plymouth.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the next year, 1858, another attempt was made, with\n",
       "new and improved machinery and 3000 miles of cable, and\n",
       "this time it was decided that the two ships should start\n",
       "paying-out from mid-ocean, proceeding in opposite directions\n",
       "towards the two shores after splicing their cables. On the\n",
       "voyage out the expedition encountered one of the most\n",
       "fearful storms on record, which lasted over a week, and the\n",
       "British man-of-war, encumbered with the dead weight of\n",
       "the cable, came near to disaster. Part of the cable shifted,\n",
       "and those on board feared that the whole of the huge mass\n",
       "would break away and crash through the vessel’s side.\n",
       "Sixteen days after leaving Plymouth the rendezvous was\n",
       "reached, the cables were spliced and the ships started.\n",
       "After the British ship had paid out 40 miles it was discovered\n",
       "that the cable had parted at some distance from\n",
       "the ship, and the vessels once more sought each other, and\n",
       "spliced again ready for another effort. This time the cable\n",
       "parted after each vessel had paid out a little more than<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_147\">147</span>\n",
       "100 miles, and the ships were forced to abandon the\n",
       "attempt.</p>\n",
       "<p>The failure of this second expedition naturally caused\n",
       "great discouragement, and the general feeling was that the\n",
       "whole enterprise would have to be given up. The chairman\n",
       "of the company recommended that in order to make the\n",
       "best of a bad job the remainder of the cable should be sold,\n",
       "and the proceeds divided amongst the shareholders, but\n",
       "after great efforts on the part of a dauntless few who refused\n",
       "to admit defeat, it was finally decided to make one\n",
       "more effort. No time was lost, and on 17th July 1858\n",
       "the vessels again sailed from Queenstown. As before, the\n",
       "cables were spliced in mid-ocean, and this time, after many\n",
       "anxious days, many false alarms, and one or two narrow\n",
       "escapes from disaster through faulty pieces of cable discovered\n",
       "almost too late, the cable was landed successfully\n",
       "on both shores of the Atlantic early in August.</p>\n",
       "<p>The Atlantic cable was now an accomplished fact, and\n",
       "dismal forebodings were turned into expressions of extravagant\n",

       "Victoria and the President of the United States, and\n",
       "amongst the more important communications was one\n",
       "which prevented the sailing from Canada of two British\n",
       "regiments which had been ordered to India during the\n",
       "Mutiny. In the meantime the Indian Mutiny had been\n",
       "suppressed, and therefore these regiments were not required.\n",
       "The dispatch of this message saved a sum of about\n",
       "£50,000. The prospects of the cable company seemed\n",
       "bright, but after a short time the signals began to grow\n",
       "weaker and weaker, and finally, after about seven hundred\n",
       "messages had been transmitted, the cable failed altogether.\n",
       "This was a great blow to the general public, and we can\n",
       "imagine the bitter disappointment of the engineers and\n",
       "electricians who had laboured so hard and so long to bring<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_148\">148</span>\n",
       "the cable into being. It was a favourable opportunity for\n",
       "the croakers, and amongst a certain section of the public\n",
       "doubts were expressed as to whether any messages had\n",
       "been transmitted at all.</p>\n",
       "<p>A great consultation of experts took place with the\n",
       "object of determining the cause of the failure, and the\n",
       "unanimous opinion was that the cable had been injured by\n",
       "the use of currents of too great intensity. Some years\n",
       "elapsed before another attempt could be made, but the\n",
       "idea was never abandoned, and a great deal of study was\n",
       "given to the problems involved. Mr. Field, the most\n",
       "energetic of the original projectors, never relaxed his determination\n",
       "that the cable should be made a success, and he\n",
       "worked incessantly to achieve his ambition. It is said\n",
       "that in pursuance of his object he made sixty-four crossings\n",
       "of the Atlantic, and considering that he suffered greatly\n",
       "from sea-sickness every time this shows remarkable pluck\n",
       "and endurance.</p>\n",
       "<p>In 1865, new capital having been raised, preparations\n",
       "were made for another expedition. It was now decided\n",
       "to use only one vessel for laying the cable, and the <i>Great\n",
       "Eastern</i> was chosen for the task. This vessel had been\n",
       "lying idle for close on ten years, owing to her failure as a\n",
       "cargo boat, but her great size and capacity made her most\n",
       "suitable for carrying the enormous weight of the whole\n",
       "cable. In July 1865 the <i>Great Eastern</i> set sail, under\n",
       "the escort of two British warships. When 84 miles had\n",
       "been paid out, a fault occurred, and after drawing up about\n",
       "10½ miles it was found that a piece of iron wire had pierced\n",
       "the coating of the cable. The trouble was put right, and\n",
       "the paying-out continued successfully until over 700 miles\n",
       "had been laid, when another fault appeared. The cable\n",
       "was again drawn in until the fault was reached, and\n",
       "another piece of iron was found piercing clean through.<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_149\">149</span>\n",
       "It was evident that two such pieces of iron could not have\n",
       "got there by accident, and there was no doubt that they\n",
       "had been inserted intentionally by some malicious scoundrel,\n",
       "most likely with the object of affecting the company’s\n",
       "shares. A start was made once more, and all went well\n",
       "until about two-thirds of the distance had been covered,\n",
       "when the cable broke and had to be abandoned after\n",
       "several nearly successful attempts to recover it.</p>\n",
       "<p>In spite of the loss, which amounted to £600,000, the\n",
       "energetic promoters contrived to raise fresh capital, and in\n",
       "1866 the <i>Great Eastern</i> started again. This effort was\n",
       "completely successful, and on 28th July 1866 the cable\n",
       "was landed amidst great rejoicing. The following extracts\n",
       "from the diary of the engineer Sir Daniell Gooch, give us\n",
       "some idea of the landing.</p>\n",

       "contrary to the popular impression. An insulated cable\n",
       "acts like a Leyden jar, in the sense that it accumulates\n",
       "electricity and does not quickly part with it, as does a bare\n",
       "overhead wire. In the case of a very long cable, such as\n",

       "the cable clear, and if a powerful current were employed\n",
       "the time occupied in this clearing would be considerable, so\n",
       "that the speed of signalling would be slow. Another\n",
       "objection to a powerful current is that if any flaw\n",
       "exists in the insulation of the cable, such a current is apt<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_152\">152</span>\n",

       "<p>The feebleness of the currents in submarine telegraphy\n",
       "makes it impossible to use the ordinary land telegraph\n",
       "receiver, and a more sensitive instrument known as the\n",
       "“mirror receiver” is used. This consists of a coil of very\n",
       "fine wire, in the centre of which a tiny magnetic needle is\n",

       "small, it is necessary to magnify them in some way, and\n",
       "this is done by fixing to the needle a very small mirror,\n",
       "upon which falls a ray of light from a lamp. The mirror\n",
       "reflects this ray on to a sheet of white paper marked with\n",
       "a scale, and as the mirror moves along with the needle the\n",

       "Philipp Reis, a teacher in a school at Friedrichsdorf, in\n",
       "Germany. His transmitting apparatus consisted of a box\n",
       "having a hole covered by a tightly stretched membrane, to\n",
       "which was attached a little strip of platinum. When the\n",
       "membrane was made to vibrate by sounds produced close\n",
       "to the box, the strip of platinum moved to and fro against\n",
       "a metal tip, which closed the circuit of a battery. The\n",
       "receiver was a long needle of soft iron round which was\n",
       "wound a coil of wire, and the ends of the needle rested on\n",
       "two little bridges of a sounding box. The vibrations of\n",
       "the membrane opened and closed the circuit at a great\n",
       "speed, and the rapid magnetization of the needle produced\n",
       "a tone of the same pitch as the one which set the membrane\n",
       "vibrating. This apparatus transmitted musical sounds and\n",
       "melodies with great accuracy, but there is considerable\n",
       "difference of opinion as to whether it was able to transmit\n",
       "speech. Professor Sylvanus Thompson distinctly states\n",
       "that Reis’s telephone could and did transmit speech, but\n",
       "other experts dispute the fact. We probably shall be quite\n",
       "safe in concluding that this telephone did transmit speech,\n",
       "but very imperfectly. In any case it is certain that the\n",
       "receiver of this apparatus is not based on the same principle\n",
       "as the modern telephone receiver.</p>\n",
       "<p>Some years later Graham Bell, Professor of Vocal\n",
       "Physiology in the University of Boston, turned his attention\n",

       "strength according to the vibratory movements of the\n",
       "membrane, and being transmitted along a wire they\n",
       "produced similar variations in current in another electro-magnet\n",

       "<p>Since the year 1876 the telephone has developed with\n",
       "remarkable rapidity, and an attempt to trace its growth\n",

       "most readers. Now, therefore, that we have introduced\n",
       "the instruments, and seen something of its principle and\n",
       "its early forms, it will be most satisfactory to omit the\n",
       "intermediate stages and to go on to the telephone as used\n",
       "in recent years. The first telephone to come into general\n",
       "use was the invention of Graham Bell, and was an improved\n",

       "the line wires. Close to the coil end of the magnet, and\n",
       "between it and the mouthpiece, is fixed a diaphragm of\n",
       "thin sheet-iron. A complete outfit consists of two of these\n",
       "instruments connected by wires, and it will be noticed that\n",
       "no battery is employed.</p>\n",
       "<p>The air vibrations set up by the voice make the\n",
       "diaphragm vibrate also, so that it moves backwards and\n",
       "forwards. These movements are infinitesimally small, but<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_158\">158</span>\n",
       "they are sufficient to affect the lines of force of the magnet\n",
       "to such an extent that rapidly alternating currents of varying\n",
       "degrees of strength are set up in the coil and sent along\n",
       "the line wire. On arriving at the receiver these currents\n",
       "pass through the coil and produce rapid variations in the\n",
       "strength of the magnet, so that instead of exerting a\n",
       "uniform attraction upon the iron diaphragm, the magnet\n",
       "pulls it with constantly varying force, and thus sets it\n",
       "vibrating. The air in front of the diaphragm now begins\n",
       "to vibrate, and the listener hears a reproduction of the\n",
       "words spoken into the transmitter. The way in which the\n",
       "fluctuations of the current make the second diaphragm\n",
       "vibrate exactly in accordance with the first is very remarkable,\n",
       "and it is important to notice that the listener does not\n",
       "hear the actual voice of the speaker, but a perfect reproduction\n",
       "of it; in fact, the second diaphragm speaks.</p>\n",
       "<p>The reader probably will be surprised to be told that\n",
       "the transmitter and the receiver of a magneto-electric\n",

       "this current through an electric motor we get mechanical\n",
       "motion back again. In the transmitter of the telephone\n",
       "just described, the mechanical motion is in the form of\n",
       "vibrations of the metal diaphragm, which set up currents of\n",

       "<p>Transmitters of the type just described work well over\n",
       "short distances, but the currents they produce are too feeble\n",
       "for transmission over a very long wire, and on this account\n",

       "broken carbon, it meets with great resistance, but if the\n",
       "bits of carbon are compressed their conducting power is\n",
       "considerably increased. Even such slight differences in\n",
       "pressure as are produced by vibrating the box will affect\n",
       "the amount of current passing through the carbon. If this\n",
       "current is led by wires to an ordinary telephone receiver\n",
       "the arrangement becomes a simple form of microphone.\n",
       "The vibrations of the box vary\n",

       "<p>It is now time to see something of the\n",
       "arrangement and working of telephone\n",
       "systems. As soon as the telephone became a commercially\n",
       "practicable instrument the necessity for some means of\n",
       "inter-communication became evident, and the telephone\n",
       "exchange was brought into being. The first exchange\n",
       "was started in 1877, in Boston, but this was a very\n",
       "small affair and it was run on very crude lines. When\n",
       "one subscriber wished to communicate with another he\n",
       "had to call up an operator, who received the message\n",
       "and repeated it to the person for whom it was intended;<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_161\">161</span>\n",
       "there was no direct communication between the various\n",
       "subscribers’ instruments. As the number of users increased\n",
       "it became necessary to devise some system\n",
       "whereby each subscriber could call the attention of an\n",
       "operator at the central station, and be put into direct\n",
       "communication with any other subscriber without delay;\n",
       "and the exchange system of to-day, which fulfils these\n",
       "requirements almost to perfection, is the result of gradual\n",
       "improvements in telephone methods extending over some\n",
       "thirty-five years.</p>\n",
       "<p>When a subscriber wishes to telephone, he first must\n",
       "call up the operator at the exchange. Until comparatively\n",
       "recently this was done by turning a handle placed at the\n",
       "side of the instrument. This handle operated a little\n",
       "dynamo, and the current produced caused a shutter at the\n",
       "exchange to drop and reveal a number, just as in the\n",
       "electric bell indicator, so that the operator knew which\n",
       "instrument was calling. As soon as the operator answered\n",
       "the call, the shutter replaced itself automatically. The\n",
       "signal to disconnect was given in the same way, but the\n",
       "indicator was of a different colour in order to prevent confusion\n",
       "with a call signal. These handle-operated telephones\n",
       "are still in common use, but they are being replaced by\n",
       "instruments which do away with handle-turning on the\n",
       "part of the subscriber, and with dropping shutters at the\n",
       "exchange. In this latest system all that the subscriber has\n",
       "to do is to lift his telephone from its rest, when a little\n",
       "electric lamp lights up at the exchange; and when he has\n",
       "finished his conversation he merely replaces the telephone,\n",
       "and again a little lamp glows.</p>\n",
       "<p>We must now see what happens at the exchange when\n",
       "a call is made. Each operator has control of a number of\n",
       "pairs of flexible cords terminating in plugs, the two cords\n",
       "of each pair being electrically connected. The plugs rest<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_162\">162</span>\n",
       "on a shelf in front of the operator, and the cords pass\n",
       "through the shelf and hang down below it. If a plug is\n",
       "lifted, the cord comes up through the shelf, and it is drawn\n",
       "back again by a weight when the plug is not in use. Two\n",
       "lamps are provided for each pair of cords, one being fixed\n",
       "close to each cord. The two wires leading from each\n",
       "subscriber’s instrument are connected to a little tube-shaped\n",
       "switch called a “jack,” and each jack has a lamp of its own.\n",
       "When a subscriber lifts his telephone from its rest a lamp\n",
       "glows, and the operator inserts one plug of a pair into the\n",
       "jack thus indicated, and the lamp goes out automatically.\n",
       "She then switches on her telephone to the caller and asks\n",
       "for the number of the subscriber to whom he wishes to\n",
       "speak; and as soon as she gets this she inserts the other\n",
       "plug of the pair into the jack belonging to this number.\n",
       "By a simple movement she then rings up the required\n",
       "person by switching on the current to his telephone bell.</p>\n",
       "<p>Here comes in the use of the two lamps connected with\n",
       "the cords. As long as the subscribers’ telephones are on\n",
       "their rests the lamps are lighted, but as soon as they are\n",
       "lifted off the lamps go out. The caller’s telephone is of\n",
       "course off its rest, and so the lamp connected with the first\n",
       "cord is not lit; but until the subscriber rung up lifts his\n",
       "instrument to answer the call, the lamp of the second cord\n",
       "remains lit, having first lighted up when the plug was\n",
       "inserted in the jack of his number. When the second\n",
       "lamp goes out the operator knows that the call has been\n",
       "responded to, and that the two subscribers are in communication\n",
       "with each other. Having finished their conversation,\n",
       "both subscribers replace their instruments on the\n",
       "rests, whereupon both lamps light up, informing the operator\n",
       "that she may disconnect by pulling out the plugs.</p>\n",
       "<p>It is manifestly impossible for one operator to attend\n",
       "to the calls of all the subscribers in the exchange, and so a<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_163\">163</span>\n",
       "number of operators are employed, each one having to\n",
       "attend to the calls of a certain number of subscribers. At\n",
       "the same time it is clear that each operator may be called\n",
       "upon to connect one of her subscribers to any other subscriber\n",
       "in the whole exchange. In order to make this\n",
       "possible the switchboard is divided into sections, each\n",
       "having as many jacks as there are lines in the exchange, so\n",
       "that in this respect all the sections are multiples of each\n",
       "other, and the whole arrangement is called a “multiple\n",
       "switchboard,” the repeated jacks being called “multiple\n",
       "jacks.” Then there are other jacks which it is not necessary\n",
       "to duplicate. We have seen that when a subscriber calls the\n",
       "exchange a lamp glows, and the operator inserts a plug into\n",
       "the jack beside the lamp, in order to answer the call and\n",
       "ascertain what number is required. These are called\n",
       "“answering jacks,” and the lamp is the line signal. It is\n",
       "usual to have three operators to each section of the switchboard,\n",
       "and each operator has charge of so many answering\n",
       "jacks, representing so many subscribers. At the same\n",
       "time she has access to the whole section, so that she can\n",
       "connect any of her subscribers to any other line in the\n",
       "exchange.</p>\n",
       "<p>When a number is called for, the operator must be able\n",
       "to tell at once whether the line is free or not. The jack\n",
       "in her section may be unoccupied, but she must know also\n",
       "whether all the multiple jacks belonging to that number\n",
       "are free, for an operator at another section may have\n",
       "connected the line to one of her subscribers. To enable\n",
       "an operator to ascertain this quickly an electrical test is\n",
       "provided. When two lines are connected, the whole of the\n",
       "multiple jacks belonging to each are charged with electricity,\n",
       "and if an operator at any section touches one of these jacks\n",
       "with a plug, a current through her receiver makes a click,\n",
       "and on hearing the click she knows that the line is engaged.<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_164\">164</span>\n",
       "The testing takes an extremely short time, and this is why a\n",
       "caller receives the reply, “Number engaged,” so promptly\n",
       "that he feels inclined to doubt whether the operator has\n",

       "five steps it acts like the first selector, and finds an idle<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_167\">167</span>\n",
       "trunk leading to the 2500 section. This places the caller’s\n",
       "line in connexion with still another switch called a\n",

       "Photographophone, and it is the invention of Ernst\n",
       "Ruhmer, a German. Its working is based upon the fact\n",
       "that the intensity of the light of the electric arc may be\n",
       "varied by sound vibrations, each variation in the latter\n",
       "producing a corresponding variation in the amount of light.\n",
       "In the photographophone the light of an arc lamp is passed\n",
       "through a lens which focuses it upon a moving photographic\n",
       "film. By speaking or singing, the light is made to vary in\n",
       "brilliance, and proportionate effects are produced in the\n",
       "silver bromide of the film. On developing the film a\n",
       "permanent record of the changes in the light intensity is\n",

       "darkness. The film is now moved forward from end to\n",
       "end in front of a fairly powerful lamp. The light passes\n",
       "through the film, and falls upon a sort of plate made of\n",
       "selenium. This is a non-metallic substance which possesses\n",
       "the curious property of altering its resistance to an electric\n",

       "with a telephone receiver and with a battery. As the film\n",
       "travels along, its varying shadings allow an ever-changing\n",
       "amount of light to pass through and fall upon the selenium,\n",
       "which varies its resistance accordingly. The resulting\n",

       "original sounds made by the voice. The reproduction of\n",
       "speech by the photographophone is quite good, but as a\n",
       "rule it is not so perfect as with the telegraphone.</p>\n",
       "<p>About ten years ago a German inventor, Professor A.\n",
       "Korn, brought out the first really practical method of\n",
       "telegraphing drawings or photographs. This invention is\n",
       "remarkable not only for what it accomplishes, but perhaps\n",
       "still more for the ingenuity with which the many peculiar\n",
       "difficulties of the process are overcome. Like the photographophone,\n",
       "Korn’s photo-telegraphic apparatus utilizes\n",
       "the power of selenium to alter its resistance with the amount\n",
       "of light reaching it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Almost everybody is familiar with the terms “positive”\n",
       "and “negative” as used in photography. The finished paper\n",
       "print is a positive, with light and shade in the correct\n",
       "positions; while the glass plate from which the print is made\n",
       "is a negative, with light and shade reversed. The lantern\n",
       "slide also is a positive, and it is exactly like the paper print,\n",
       "except that it has a base of glass instead of paper, so that\n",
       "it is transparent. Similarly, a positive may be made on a\n",
       "piece of celluloid, and this, besides being transparent, is\n",
       "flexible. The first step in transmitting on the Korn system\n",
       "is to make from the photograph to be telegraphed a positive\n",
       "of this kind, both transparent and flexible. This is bent\n",
       "round a glass drum or cylinder, and fixed so that it cannot\n",
       "possibly move. The cylinder is given a twofold movement.<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_175\">175</span>\n",
       "It is rotated by means of an electric motor, and at\n",
       "the same time it is made to travel slowly along in the\n",
       "direction of its length. In fact its movement is very\n",
       "similar to that of a screw, which turns round and moves\n",
       "forward at the same time. A powerful beam of light is\n",
       "concentrated upon the positive. This beam remains\n",
       "stationary, but owing to the dual movement of the cylinder\n",
       "it passes over every part of the positive, following a spiral\n",
       "path. Exactly the same effect would be produced by\n",
       "keeping the cylinder still and moving the beam spirally\n",
       "round it, but this arrangement would be more difficult to\n",
       "manipulate. The forward movement of the cylinder is\n",
       "extremely small, so that the spiral is as fine as it is possible\n",
       "to get it without having adjacent lines actually touching.\n",
       "The light passes through the positive into the cylinder, and\n",
       "is reflected towards a selenium cell; and as the positive\n",
       "has an almost infinite number of gradations of tone, or\n",
       "degrees of light and shade, the amount of light reaching\n",
       "the cell varies constantly all the time. The selenium\n",
       "therefore alters its resistance, and allows a constantly\n",
       "varying current to pass through it, and so to the transmission\n",
       "line.</p>\n",
       "<p>At the receiving end is another cylinder having the\n",
       "same rotating and forward movement, and round this is\n",
       "fixed a sensitive photographic film. This film is protected\n",
       "by a screen having a small opening, and no light can reach\n",
       "it except through this aperture. The incoming current is\n",
       "made to control a beam of light focused to fall upon the\n",
       "screen aperture, the amount of light varying according to\n",
       "the amount of current. In this way the beam of light, like\n",
       "the one at the transmitting end, traces a spiral from end to\n",
       "end of the film, and on developing the film a reproduction\n",
       "of the original photograph is obtained. The telegraphed\n",
       "photograph is thus made up of an enormous number<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_176\">176</span>\n",
       "of lines side by side, but these are so close to one\n",
       "another that they are scarcely noticed, and the effect is\n",
       "something like that of a rather coarse-grained ordinary\n",
       "photograph.</p>\n",
       "<p>It is obvious that the success of this method depends\n",
       "upon the maintaining of absolute uniformity in the motion\n",
       "of the two cylinders, and this is managed in a very ingenious\n",
       "way. It will be remembered that one method of securing\n",
       "uniformity in a number of sub-clocks under the control of\n",
       "a master-clock is that of adjusting the sub-clocks to go a\n",
       "little faster than the master-clock. Then, when the sub-clocks\n",
       "reach the hour, they are held back by electro-magnetic\n",
       "action until the master-clock arrives at the hour,\n",
       "when all proceed together.</p>\n",
       "<p>A similar method is employed for the cylinders. They\n",
       "are driven by electric motors, and the motor at the receiving\n",
       "end is adjusted so as to run very slightly faster\n",
       "than the motor at the sending end. The result is that\n",
       "the receiving cylinder completes one revolution a minute\n",
       "fraction of a second before the transmitting cylinder. It\n",
       "is then automatically held back until the sending cylinder\n",
       "completes its revolution, and then both commence the next\n",
       "revolution exactly together. The pause made by the\n",
       "receiving cylinder is of extremely short duration, but in\n",
       "order that there shall be no break in the spiral traced by\n",
       "light upon the film, the pause takes place at the point\n",
       "where the ends of the film come together. In actual\n",
       "practice certain other details of adjustment are required\n",
       "to ensure precision in working, but the main features of\n",
       "the process are as described.</p>\n",
       "<p>Although the above photo-telegraphic process is very\n",
       "satisfactory in working, it has been superseded to some\n",
       "extent by another process of a quite different nature. By\n",
       "copying the original photograph through a glass screen<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_177\">177</span>\n",
       "covered with a multitude of very fine parallel lines, a half-tone\n",
       "reproduction is made. This is formed of an immense\n",
       "number of light and dark lines of varying breadth, and it\n",
       "is printed in non-conducting ink on lead-foil, so that while\n",
       "the dark lines are bare foil, the light ones are covered with\n",
       "the ink. This half-tone is placed round a metal cylinder\n",
       "having the same movement as the cylinders in the previous\n",
       "processes, and a metal point, or “stylus” as it is called, is\n",
       "made to rest lightly upon the foil picture, so that it travels\n",
       "all over it, from one end to the other. An electrical circuit\n",
       "is arranged so that when the stylus touches a piece of the\n",
       "bare foil a current is sent out along the line wire. This\n",
       "current is therefore intermittent, being interrupted each\n",
       "time the stylus passes over a part of the half-tone picture\n",
       "covered with the non-conducting ink, the succeeding\n",
       "periods of current and no current varying with the breadth\n",
       "of the conducting and the non-conducting lines. This\n",
       "intermittent current goes to a similar arrangement of\n",
       "stylus and cylinder at the receiving end, this cylinder\n",
       "having round it a sheet of paper coated with a chemical\n",
       "preparation. The coating is white all over to begin with,\n",
       "but it turns black wherever the current passes through it.\n",
       "The final result is that the intermittent current builds up\n",
       "a reproduction in black-and-white of the original photograph.\n",
       "In this process also the cylinders have to be\n",

       "wireless telegraphy.</p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_180\">180</span></p>\n",
       "<p>The idea of communicating without any connecting\n",
       "wires is an old one. About the year 1842, Morse, of telegraph\n",
       "fame, succeeded in transmitting telegraphic signals\n",
       "across rivers and canals without a connecting wire. His\n",
       "method was to stretch along each bank of the river a wire\n",
       "equal in length to three times the breadth of the river.\n",
       "One of these wires was connected with the transmitter and\n",
       "with a battery, and the other with a receiver, both wires\n",
       "terminating in copper plates sunk in the water. In this\n",
       "case the water took the place of a connecting wire, and\n",
       "acted as the conducting medium. A few years later\n",
       "another investigator, a Scotchman named Lindsay, succeeded\n",
       "in telegraphing across the river Tay, at a point\n",
       "where it is over a mile and a half wide, by similar methods.\n",
       "Lindsay appears to have been the first to suggest the possibility\n",
       "of telegraphing across the Atlantic, and although at\n",
       "that time, 1845, the idea must have seemed a wild one, he\n",
       "had the firmest faith in its ultimate accomplishment.</p>\n",
       "<p>Amongst those who followed Lindsay’s experiments\n",
       "with keen interest was the late Sir William, then Mr.\n",
       "Preece, but it was not until 1882, twenty years after\n",
       "Lindsay’s death, that he commenced experiments on his\n",
       "own account. In March of that year the cable across the\n",
       "Solent failed, and Preece took the opportunity of trying to\n",
       "signal across without a connecting wire. He used two\n",
       "overhead wires, each terminating in large copper plates\n",
       "sunk in the sea, one stretching from Southampton to\n",
       "Southsea Pier, and the other from Ryde Pier to Sconce\n",
       "Point. The experiment was successful, audible Morse\n",
       "signals being received on each side. In this experiment,\n",
       "as in those of Morse and Lindsay, the water acted as the\n",
       "conducting medium; but a year or two later, Preece\n",
       "turned his attention to a different method of wireless communication,\n",
       "by means of induction. This method was<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_181\">181</span>\n",
       "based upon the fact that at the instant of starting and\n",
       "stopping a current in one wire, another current is induced\n",
       "in a second wire placed parallel to it, even when the two\n",
       "wires are a considerable distance apart. Many successful\n",
       "experiments in this induction telegraphy were made, one\n",
       "of the most striking being that between the Island of Mull\n",
       "and the mainland, in 1895. The cable between the island\n",
       "and the mainland had broken, and by means of induction\n",
       "perfect telegraphic communication was maintained during\n",
       "the time that the cable was being repaired. Although this\n",
       "system of wireless telegraphy is quite successful for short\n",
       "distances, it becomes impracticable when the distance is\n",
       "increased, because the length of each of the two parallel\n",
       "wires must be roughly equal to the distance between them.\n",
       "These experiments of Preece are of great interest, but we\n",

       "of a Leyden jar did not consist of only one sudden rush of\n",
       "electricity, but of a series of electric oscillations, which\n",
       "surged backwards and forwards until electric equilibrium\n",
       "was restored. This discovery was verified by later\n",
       "experimenters, and it forms the foundation of our knowledge\n",
       "of electric waves. At this point many readers probably\n",
       "will ask, “What are electric waves?” It is impossible to\n",
       "answer this question fully, for we still have a great deal to\n",
       "learn about these waves, and we only can state the conclusions\n",
       "at which our greatest scientists have arrived after\n",
       "much thought and many experiments. It is believed that\n",
       "all space is filled with a medium to which the name\n",
       "“ether” has been given, and that this ether extends<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_182\">182</span>\n",
       "throughout the matter. We do not know what the ether\n",
       "is, but the important fact is that it can receive and transmit\n",
       "vibrations in the form of ether waves. There are different\n",
       "kinds of ether waves, and they produce entirely different\n",
       "effects. Some of them produce the effect which we call\n",
       "light, and these are called “light waves.” Others produce\n",
       "the effect known as heat, and they are called “heat waves”;\n",
       "and still others produce electricity, and these we call\n",
       "“electric waves.” These waves travel through the ether at\n",
       "the enormous speed of 186,000 miles per second, so that\n",
       "they would cross the Atlantic Ocean in about 1/80 second.\n",
       "The fact that light also travels at this speed suggested that\n",
       "there might be some connexion between the two sets of\n",
       "waves, and after much experiment it has been demonstrated\n",
       "that the waves of light and electricity are identical except\n",
       "in their length.</p>\n",
       "<p>Later on in this chapter we shall have occasion to refer\n",
       "frequently to wave-length, and we may take this opportunity\n",
       "of explaining what is understood by this term. Wave-length\n",
       "is the distance measured from the crest of one wave\n",
       "to the crest of the next, across the intervening trough or\n",
       "hollow. From this it will be seen that the greater the\n",
       "wave-length, the farther apart are the waves; and also that\n",
       "if we have two sets of waves of different wave-lengths but\n",
       "travelling at the same speed, then the number of waves\n",
       "arriving at any point in one second will be greater in the\n",
       "case of the shorter waves, because these are closer together.</p>\n",
       "<p>A tuning-fork in vibration disturbs the surrounding air,\n",
       "and sets up air waves which produce the effect called sound\n",
       "when they strike against the drums of our ears. In a\n",
       "similar way the discharge of a Leyden jar disturbs the\n",
       "surrounding ether, and sets up electric ether waves; but\n",
       "these waves produce no effect upon us in the shape of sight,\n",
       "sound, or feeling. There is however a very simple piece<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_183\">183</span>\n",
       "of apparatus which acts as a sort of electric eye or ear, and\n",
       "detects the waves for us. This consists of a glass tube\n",
       "loosely filled with metal filings, and having a cork at each\n",
       "end. A wire is passed through each cork so as to project\n",
       "well into the tube, but so that the two ends do not touch\n",
       "one another, and the outer ends of these wires are connected\n",
       "to a battery of one or two cells, and to some kind of\n",
       "electrically worked apparatus, such as an electric bell. So\n",
       "long as the filings lie quite loosely in the tube they offer\n",
       "a very high resistance, and no current passes. If now\n",
       "electric waves are set up by the discharge of a Leyden jar,\n",
       "these waves fall upon the tube and cause the resistance\n",
       "of the filings to decrease greatly. The filings now form a\n",
       "conducting path through which the current passes, and so\n",
       "the bell rings. If no further discharge takes place the\n",
       "electric waves cease, but the filings do not return to their\n",
       "original highly resistant condition, but retain their conductivity,\n",
       "and the current continues to pass, and the bell\n",
       "goes on ringing. To stop the bell it is only necessary\n",
       "to tap the tube gently, when the filings immediately fall\n",
       "back into their first state, so that the current cannot pass\n",

       "though not the most sensitive, is the Marconi magnetic detector,\n",
       "<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#plate_XIIIb\">Plate XIII.<i>b</i></a>. This consists of a moving band made\n",
       "of several soft iron wires twisted together, and passing close\n",
       "to the poles of two horse-shoe magnets. As the band\n",
       "passes from the influence of one magnet to that of the other\n",
       "its magnetism becomes reversed, but the change takes a\n",

       "the electric waves from the transmitting station fall upon\n",
       "the aerial of the receiving station, small, rapidly oscillating\n",
       "currents pass through the first coil, and these have the\n",
       "effect of making the band reverse its magnetism instantly.\n",
       "The sudden moving of the lines of magnetic force induces\n",
       "a current in the second coil, and produces a click in the\n",
       "telephone. As long as the waves continue, the clicks\n",
       "follow one another rapidly, and they are broken up into the\n",
       "long and short signals of the Morse code according to the\n",
       "manipulation of the Morse key at the sending station.\n",

       "power possessed by certain crystals to rectify the oscillatory\n",
       "currents received from the aerial, converting them into\n",
       "uni-directional currents. At every discharge of the condenser\n",
       "at the sending station a number of complete waves,\n",
       "forming what is called a “train” of waves, is set in motion.\n",
       "From each train of waves the crystal detector produces one\n",
       "uni-directional pulsation of current, and this causes a click\n",
       "in the telephone receiver. If these single pulsations follow\n",
       "one another rapidly and regularly, a musical note is heard\n",
       "in the receiver. Various combinations of crystals, and\n",
       "crystals and metal points, are used, but all work in the\n",
       "same way. Some combinations work without assistance,\n",
       "but others require to have a small current passed through\n",
       "them from a local battery. The crystals are held in small\n",
       "cups of brass or copper, mounted so that they can be\n",
       "adjusted by means of set-screws. Crystal detectors are\n",
       "extremely sensitive, but they require very accurate adjustment,\n",
       "and any vibration quickly throws them out of order.</p>\n",
       "<p>The “electrolytic” detector rectifies the oscillating\n",
       "currents in a different manner. One form consists of a thin\n",
       "platinum wire passing down into a vessel made of lead,\n",
       "and containing a weak solution of sulphuric acid. The\n",
       "two terminals of a battery are connected to the wire and\n",
       "the vessel respectively. As long as no oscillations are\n",
       "received from the aerial the current is unable to flow\n",
       "between the wire and the vessel, but when the oscillations\n",
       "reach the detector the current at once passes, and operates\n",
       "the telephone receiver. The action of this detector is not\n",
       "thoroughly understood, and the way in which the point of\n",
       "the platinum wire prevents the passing of the current until\n",
       "the oscillations arrive from the aerial is something of a\n",
       "mystery.</p>\n",
       "<p>The last detector that need be described is the Fleming<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_191\">191</span>\n",

       "the lamp. The plate and the filament do not touch\n",
       "one another, but when the lamp is lighted up a current can\n",
       "be passed from the plate to the filament, but not from filament\n",
       "to plate. This receiver acts in a similar way to the\n",

       "is sounding strongly place near it another fork of the same\n",
       "pitch and one of a different pitch, we find that the fork of\n",
       "similar pitch also begins to sound faintly, whereas the third<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_192\">192</span>\n",
       "fork remains silent. The explanation is that the two forks\n",
       "of similar pitch have the same natural rate of vibration,\n",
       "while the other fork vibrates at a different rate. When\n",
       "the first fork is struck, it vibrates at a certain rate, and sets\n",
       "in motion air waves of a certain length. These waves\n",
       "reach both the other forks, but their effect is different in\n",
       "each case. On reaching the fork of similar pitch the first\n",
       "wave sets it vibrating, but not sufficiently to give out a\n",
       "sound. But following this wave come others, and as the\n",
       "fork has the same rate of vibration as the fork which\n",
       "produced the waves, each wave arrives just at the right\n",
       "moment to add its impulse to that of the preceding wave,\n",
       "so that the effect accumulates and the fork sounds. In the\n",
       "case of the third fork of different pitch, the first wave sets\n",
       "it also vibrating, but as this fork cannot vibrate at the same\n",
       "rate as the one producing the waves, the latter arrive at\n",
       "wrong intervals; and instead of adding together their\n",
       "impulses they interfere with one another, each upsetting\n",
       "the work of the one before it, and the fork does not sound.\n",
       "The same thing may be illustrated with a pendulum. If\n",
       "we give a pendulum a gentle push at intervals corresponding\n",
       "to its natural rate of swing, the effects of all these\n",
       "pushes are added together, and the pendulum is made to\n",
       "swing vigorously. If, on the other hand, we give the pushes\n",
       "at longer or shorter intervals, they will not correspond with\n",
       "the pendulum’s rate of swing, so that while some pushes\n",
       "will help the pendulum, others will hinder it, and the final\n",
       "result will be that the pendulum is brought almost to a\n",
       "standstill, instead of being made to swing strongly and\n",
       "regularly. The same principle holds good with wireless\n",
       "aerials. Any aerial will respond readily to all other aerials\n",
       "having the same rate of oscillation, because the waves in\n",
       "each case are of the same length; that is to say, they follow\n",
       "one another at the same intervals. On the other hand, an<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_193\">193</span>\n",
       "aerial will not respond readily to waves from another aerial\n",
       "having a different rate of oscillation, because these do not\n",
       "follow each other at intervals to suit it.</p>\n",
       "<p>If each station could receive signals only from stations\n",
       "having aerials similar to its own, its usefulness would be\n",
       "very limited, and so all stations are provided with means\n",
       "of altering the rate of oscillation of their aerials. The\n",
       "actual tuning apparatus by which this is accomplished need\n",
       "not be described, as it is complicated, but what happens in\n",
       "practice is this: The operator, wearing telephone receivers\n",
       "fixed over his ears by means of a head band, sits at a\n",
       "desk upon which are placed his various instruments. He\n",
       "adjusts the tuning apparatus to a position in which\n",
       "signals from stations of widely different wave-lengths are\n",
       "received fairly well, and keeps a general look out over\n",
       "passing signals. Presently he hears his own call-signal,\n",
       "and knows that some station wishes to communicate with\n",
       "him. Immediately he alters the adjustment of his tuner\n",
       "until his aerial responds freely to the waves from this\n",
       "station, but not to waves from other stations, and in this\n",
       "way he is able to cut out signals from other stations and to\n",
       "listen to the message without interruption.</p>\n",
       "<p>Unfortunately wireless tuning is yet far from perfect in\n",
       "certain respects. For instance, if two stations are transmitting\n",
       "at the same time on the same wave-length, it is\n",
       "clearly impossible for a receiving operator to cut one out\n",
       "by wave-tuning, and to listen to the other only. In such\n",
       "a case, however, it generally happens that although the\n",
       "wave-frequency is the same, the frequency of the wave\n",
       "groups or trains is different, so that there is a difference\n",
       "in the notes heard in the telephones; and a skilful operator\n",
       "can distinguish between the two sufficiently well to read\n",
       "whichever message is intended for him. The stations\n",
       "which produce a clear, medium-pitched note are the easiest<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_194\">194</span>\n",
       "to receive from, and in many cases it is possible to identify\n",
       "a station at once by its characteristic note. Tuning is also\n",
       "unable to prevent signals from a powerful station close at\n",

       "<p>Another source of trouble lies in interference by atmospheric\n",
       "electricity. Thunderstorms, especially in the\n",
       "tropics, interfere greatly with the reception of signals,\n",
       "the lightning discharges giving rise to violent, irregular\n",
       "groups of waves which produce loud noises in the telephones.\n",
       "There are also silent electrical disturbances in the\n",

       "weird effects. Atmospheric discharges are very irregular,\n",
       "without any real wave-length, so that an operator cannot\n",
       "cut them out by wave-tuning pure and simple in the way\n",
       "just described, as they defy him by affecting equally all\n",
       "adjustments. Fortunately, the irregularity of the atmospherics\n",
       "produces correspondingly irregular sounds in the\n",
       "telephones, quite unlike the clear steady note of a wireless\n",
       "station; and unless the atmospherics are unusually strong\n",
       "this note pierces through them, so that the signals can be\n",
       "read. The effects of lightning discharges are too violent\n",
       "to be got rid of satisfactorily, and practically all that can\n",
       "be done is to reduce the loudness of the noises in the\n",
       "telephones, so that the operator is not temporarily deafened.\n",
       "During violent storms in the near neighbourhood of a\n",

       "<p>The methods and apparatus we have described so far<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_195\">195</span>\n",

       "experts that his system was thoroughly sound. Commencing\n",
       "with a distance of about 100 yards, Marconi\n",
       "rapidly increased the range of his experiments, and by\n",
       "the end of 1897 he succeeded in transmitting signals\n",

       "miles away. In 1899 messages were exchanged between\n",
       "British warships 85 miles apart, and the crowning achievement\n",
       "was reached in 1901, when Marconi received readable\n",
       "signals at St. John’s, Newfoundland, from Poldhu in Cornwall,\n",
       "a distance of about 1800 miles. In 1907 the Marconi\n",
       "stations at Clifden and Glace Bay were opened for public\n",
       "service, and by the following year transatlantic wireless\n",
       "communication was in full swing. The sending of wireless\n",
       "signals across the Atlantic was a remarkable accomplishment,\n",

       "Marconi sailed for Buenos Ayres, and wireless communication\n",

       "be of interest. We have seen that an ordinary spark gap,\n",
       "formed by two metal balls a short distance apart, becomes\n",
       "overheated by the rapid succession of discharges, with the\n",
       "result that the sparking is irregular. What actually\n",
       "happens is that the violent discharge tears off and vaporizes\n",
       "minute particles of the metal. This intensely heated\n",
       "vapour forms a conducting path which the current is able\n",
       "to cross, so that an arc is produced just in the same way\n",
       "as in the arc lamp. This arc is liable to be formed by\n",
       "each discharge, and it lasts long enough to prevent the\n",
       "sparks from following one another promptly. In the\n",
       "Marconi system this trouble is avoided by means of a\n",
       "rotating spark gap, but in the German “Telefunken”\n",
       "system, so named from Greek <em>tele</em>, far off, and German\n",
       "<i lang=\"de\">Funke</i>, a spark, a fixed compound spark gap is used\n",

       "tiny gaps one after the other. The discs are about\n",
       "3 inches in diameter, and their effect is to conduct away\n",
       "quickly the heat of the discharge. By this means the\n",

       "discharge is over immediately, the sparks being said to be\n",

       "presses a key, and out across the waters speed electric\n",
       "waves bearing the wireless cry for help, “S.O.S.,” incessantly\n",
       "repeated. Far away, on another liner, is a\n",
       "similar small cabin, and its occupant is busy with messages\n",

       "comes the call from the stricken vessel, and instantly all\n",

       "answered, the position of the doomed ship received, and\n",
       "the captain is informed. A few orders are hurriedly given,\n",
       "the ship’s course is changed, and away she steams to the\n",

       "rarer metal, such as gold, silver, or nickel, upon the\n",
       "surface of baser or commoner metals; and electrotyping is\n",
       "the copying of casts, medals, types, and other similar\n",
       "objects. The fact that metals could be deposited by the\n",
       "decomposition of a solution by a current was known in the\n",
       "early days of the voltaic cell, but no one seems to have\n",
       "paid much attention to it. An Italian chemist published\n",
       "in 1805 an account of his success in coating two silver\n",
       "medals with gold, and some thirty years later Bessemer\n",
       "transformed lead castings into fairly presentable ornaments\n",
       "by coating them with copper, but commercial electroplating\n",
       "may be said to have begun about 1840, when an\n",
       "Englishman named Elkington took out a patent for the\n",
       "process. Since then the processes of electroplating and\n",
       "electrotyping have rapidly come more and more into use,\n",
       "until to-day they are practised on a vast scale, giving employment\n",

       "across the top of this vessel, and from one of these is\n",
       "suspended a plate of the same metal as that in the solution,\n",
       "and from the other is hung the article to receive the\n",
       "coating. The positive terminal of a voltaic battery is\n",
       "connected to the rod supporting the plate, and the negative\n",
       "terminal to the rod carrying the article to be plated. As\n",
       "the current passes through the solution from the plate to the\n",

       "of electric belts, rings, and other similar appliances\n",
       "have appeared regularly for many years in our newspapers\n",

       "Röntgen or X-rays in examining the various bones of the\n",
       "body. By means of the fluorescent screen it is quite easy\n",
       "to find and examine fractures and dislocations, and many\n",
       "of the diseases of the bones and joints can be seen and\n",
       "recognized. Metals are opaque to the X-rays, and so the\n",
       "screen shows plainly such objects as needles or bullets\n",
       "embedded in the flesh. Sometimes people, especially\n",
       "young children, swallow coins and other small metal articles,\n",
       "and here again the X-rays will show the exact position of\n",
       "the intruder. A particularly valuable application of the\n",
       "rays is in the discovering and locating of tiny fragments of\n",
       "metal in the eye, for very often it is quite impossible to do\n",
       "this by ordinary observation. Most of these fragments are\n",
       "of steel or iron, and they are most easily removed by means\n",
       "of an electro-magnet. If the fragment is very small a\n",
       "powerful magnet is used, one capable of supporting 500\n",
       "or 600 lb.; but if it is fairly large a weaker magnet,\n",
       "supporting perhaps 30 lb., must be employed, because\n",
       "the forceful and rapid dragging out of a large body might\n",
       "seriously damage the eye.</p>\n",
       "<p>If the chest is examined by the Röntgen rays the lungs\n",
       "are seen as light spaces between the clearly marked ribs,\n",
       "and any spot of congestion appears as a darker patch. In\n",
       "this way the early stages of consumption may be revealed,\n",
       "and in pneumonia and other similar complaints valuable\n",
       "information regarding the condition of the lungs can be\n",
       "obtained. It is possible also to follow to a considerable extent\n",
       "the processes of digestion. X-rays easily pass through ordinary\n",
       "food, but if bismuth oxychloride, which is quite harmless,\n",
       "is mixed with the food, the mixture becomes opaque<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_243\">243</span>\n",
       "to the rays, and so its course may be followed on the screen.\n",
       "The normal movements of the food are well known, and an\n",
       "abnormal halt is probably caused by an obstruction of some\n",
       "kind, and thus the X-rays enable the physician to locate\n",
       "the obstruction, and to form an opinion of its nature.</p>\n",
       "<p>In our chapter on wireless telegraphy we saw that the\n",
       "discharge of a Leyden jar takes the form of a number of\n",
       "rapid oscillations backwards and forwards. These oscillations\n",
       "take place at a rate of more than half a million per\n",
       "second, but by the use of an apparatus called a “high frequency\n",
       "transformer” the rate is increased to more than a\n",
       "million per second. Electricity in this state of rapid oscillation\n",
       "is known as high frequency electricity, and high frequency\n",
       "currents are very valuable for some kinds of medical\n",
       "work. The application of these currents is quite painless, and\n",
       "but for the strange-looking apparatus the patient probably\n",
       "would not know that anything unusual was taking place.\n",
       "To some extent the effect maybe said to be not unlike that\n",

       "disordered nerves are quickly relieved, and even such\n",
       "obstinate complaints as neuritis and crippling rheumatism\n",
       "have been cured. The treatment is also of great value in\n",
       "certain forms of heart trouble. By increasing the strength\n",
       "of the high frequency currents the tissues actually may\n",

       "wire, shaped according to the purpose for which it is\n",
       "intended, and it is used at a dull red heat. Very tiny\n",

       "<p>In the Finsen light treatment electric light is used for<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_244\">244</span>\n",
       "a very different purpose. The spectrum of white light consists\n",
       "of the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,\n",
       "and violet. Just beyond the violet end of the spectrum are\n",
       "the ultra-violet rays. Ultra-violet light consists of waves\n",
       "of light which are so short as to be quite invisible to the\n",
       "eye, and Dr. N. R. Finsen, a Danish physician, made the\n",
       "discovery that this light is capable of destroying bacterial\n",
       "germs. In the application of ultra-violet rays to medical\n",
       "work, artificial light is used in preference to sunlight; for\n",
       "though the latter contains ultra-violet light, a great deal of\n",
       "it is absorbed in passing through the atmosphere. Besides\n",
       "this, the sun sends out an immense amount of radiant heat,\n",
       "and this has to be filtered out before the light can be used.\n",
       "The usual source of light is the electric arc, and the arc is\n",
       "much richer in ultra-violet rays if it is formed between\n",
       "electrodes of iron, instead of the usual carbon rods. The\n",
       "light, which, in addition to the ultra-violet rays, includes\n",
       "the blue, indigo, and violet parts of the spectrum, is passed\n",
       "along a tube something like that of a telescope, and is\n",
       "focused by means of a double lens, consisting of two\n",
       "separate plates of quartz. Glass cannot be used for the\n",
       "lens, because it is opaque to the extreme ultra-violet rays.\n",
       "A constant stream of water is passed between the two\n",
       "plates forming the lens, and this filters out the heat rays,\n",
       "which are not wanted. In some forms of Finsen lamp an\n",
       "electric spark is used as the source of light, in place of the\n",
       "arc.</p>\n",
       "<p>The most important application of the Finsen light is\n",
       "in the cure of the terribly disfiguring disease called lupus.\n",
       "This is a form of tuberculosis of the skin, and it is produced\n",
       "by the same deadly microbe which, when it attacks\n",
       "the lungs, causes consumption. In all but extreme cases\n",
       "the Finsen light effects a remarkable cure. A number of\n",
       "applications are necessary, each of half an hour or more;<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_245\">245</span>\n",
       "and after a time the disease begins to disappear, leaving\n",
       "soft, normal skin. The exact action of the light rays is a\n",
       "disputed point. Finsen himself believed that the ultra-violet\n",
       "rays attacked and exterminated the microbe, but a\n",
       "later theory is that the rays stimulate the tissues to such\n",
       "an extent that they are enabled to cure themselves. As\n",
       "early as the year 1899 Finsen had employed his light\n",
       "treatment in 350 cases of lupus, and out of this number\n",
       "only five cases were unsuccessful.</p>\n",
       "<p>The ultra-violet rays are said to have a very beneficial\n",
       "effect upon the teeth. Experiments carried out in Paris,\n",
       "using a mercury vapour lamp as the source of light, show\n",
       "that discoloured teeth are whitened and given a pearly\n",
       "lustre by these rays, at the same time being sterilized so\n",
       "that they do not easily decay. The Röntgen rays are\n",
       "used for the treatment of lupus, and more particularly for\n",
       "deeper growths, such as tumours and cancers, for which\n",
       "the Finsen rays are useless, owing to their lack of penetrating\n",
       "power. The action of these two kinds of rays appears\n",
       "to be similar, but the X-rays are much the more active of\n",
       "the two.</p>\n",

       "vehicles or automobiles, belongs to the important\n",
       "class of internal-combustion engines. Combustion means\n",
       "the operation of burning, and an internal-combustion engine\n",
       "is one in which the motive power is produced by the combustion\n",
       "of a highly explosive mixture of gases. In the\n",
       "ordinary petrol motor this mixture consists of petrol and air,\n",
       "and it is made by means of a device called a “carburetter.”\n",
       "By suction, a quantity of petrol is forced through a jet with\n",
       "a very fine nozzle, so that it is reduced to an extremely fine\n",
       "spray. A certain proportion of air is allowed to enter, and\n",
       "the mixture passes into the cylinder. Here it is compressed\n",
       "by the rising piston so that it becomes more and more\n",
       "heated, and at the right point it is ignited. Combustion\n",
       "takes place with such rapidity that it takes the form of an\n",
       "explosion, and the energy produced in this way drives\n",
       "forward the piston, which turns the crank-shaft and so\n",
       "communicates motion to the driving-wheels.</p>\n",
       "<p>The part played by electricity in this process is confined\n",
       "to the ignition of the compressed charge of petrol and air.\n",
       "This may be done in two ways; by means of an accumulator\n",
       "and a small induction coil, or by means of a dynamo driven\n",
       "by the engine. At one time the first method was employed\n",
       "exclusively, but to-day it is used as a rule only for starting<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_254\">254</span>\n",
       "the car engine, the second or magneto method being used\n",
       "when the engine has started up.</p>\n",
       "<p>In accumulator ignition the low-tension current from\n",
       "the accumulator passes through an induction coil, and is\n",
       "thus transformed to high-tension current. This current\n",
       "goes through a sparking plug, which is fixed in the head\n",
       "of the cylinder. The sparking plug contains two metal\n",
       "points separated by a tiny air gap of from about 1/30 to 1/50\n",
       "inch. This gap provides the only possible path for the\n",
       "high-tension current, so that the latter leaps across it in\n",
       "the form of a spark. The spark is arranged to take place\n",
       "when the piston is at the top of its stroke, that is, when the\n",
       "explosive mixture is at its maximum compression, and the\n",
       "heat of the spark ignites the mixture, the resulting explosion\n",
       "forcing down the piston with great power. In practice it\n",
       "is found better as a rule to cause the spark to pass very\n",
       "slightly before the piston reaches the extreme limit of its\n",
       "stroke. The reason of this is that the process of igniting\n",
       "and exploding the charge occupies an appreciable, though\n",
       "of course exceedingly small amount of time. Immediately\n",
       "on reaching the top of its stroke the piston begins to\n",
       "descend again, and if the spark and the top of the stroke\n",
       "coincide in time the explosion does not take place until the\n",
       "piston has moved some little distance down the cylinder,\n",
       "and so a certain amount of power is lost. By having the\n",
       "spark a little in advance of the piston, the explosion occurs\n",
       "at the instant when the piston begins to return, and so the\n",
       "full force of the explosion is utilized.</p>\n",
       "<p>In magneto ignition the current is supplied by a small\n",
       "dynamo. This generates alternating current, and it is\n",
       "driven by the car engine. The current is at first at low\n",
       "pressure, and it has to be transformed to high-tension\n",
       "current in order to produce the spark. There are two\n",
       "methods of effecting this transformation. One is by turning<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_255\">255</span>\n",
       "the armature of the dynamo into a sort of induction coil, by\n",
       "giving it two separate windings, primary and secondary;\n",
       "so that the dynamo delivers high-tension current directly.\n",
       "The other method is to send the low-tension current\n",
       "through one or more transformer coils, just as in accumulator\n",
       "ignition. Accumulators can give current only for a\n",
       "certain limited period, and they are liable consequently to\n",
       "run down at inconvenient times and places. They also\n",
       "have the defect of undergoing a slight leakage of current\n",
       "even when they are not in use. Magneto ignition has\n",
       "neither of these drawbacks, and on account of its superior\n",
       "reliability it has come into universal use.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the working of quarries and mines of various kinds,\n",
       "and also in large engineering undertakings, blasting plays\n",
       "a prominent part. Under all conditions blasting is a more\n",
       "or less dangerous business, and it has been the cause of\n",
       "very many serious accidents to the men engaged in carrying\n",
       "it out. Many of these accidents are due to the carelessness\n",
       "resulting from long familiarity with the work, but apart\n",
       "from this the danger lies principally in uncertainty in\n",
       "exploding the charge. Sometimes the explosion occurs\n",
       "sooner than expected, so that the men have not time to get\n",
       "away to a safe distance. Still more deadly is the delayed\n",
       "explosion. After making the necessary arrangements the\n",
       "men retire out of danger, and await the explosion. This\n",
       "does not take place at the expected time, and after waiting\n",
       "a little longer the men conclude that the ignition has failed,\n",
       "and return to put matters right. Then the explosion takes\n",
       "place, and the men are killed instantly or at least seriously\n",
       "injured. Although it is impossible to avoid altogether\n",
       "dangers of this nature, the risk can be reduced to the\n",
       "minimum by igniting the explosives by electricity.</p>\n",
       "<p>Electrical shot firing may be carried out in different\n",
       "ways, according to circumstances. The current is supplied<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_256\">256</span>\n",
       "either by a dynamo or by a battery, and the firing is controlled\n",
       "from a switchboard placed at a safe distance from the point\n",
       "at which the charge is to be exploded, the connexions being\n",
       "made by long insulated wires. The actual ignition is\n",
       "effected by a hot spark, as in automobile ignition, or by an\n",
       "electric detonator or fuse. Explosives such as dynamite\n",
       "cannot be fired by simple ignition, but require to be\n",
       "detonated. This is effected by a detonator consisting of a\n",
       "small cup-shaped tube, made of ebonite or other similar\n",
       "material. The wires conveying the current project into this\n",
       "tube, and are connected by a short piece of very fine wire\n",
       "having a high resistance. Round this wire is packed a\n",
       "small quantity of gun-cotton, and beyond, in a sort of continuation\n",
       "of the tube, is placed an extremely explosive\n",
       "substance called “fulminate of mercury,” the whole arrangement\n",
       "being surrounded by the dynamite to be fired. When\n",
       "all is ready the man at the switchboard manipulates a\n",
       "switch, and the current passes to the detonator and forces\n",
       "its way through the resistance of the thin connecting wire.\n",
       "This wire becomes sufficiently hot to ignite the gun-cotton,\n",
       "and so explode the fulminate of mercury. The explosion\n",
       "is so violent that the dynamite charge is detonated, and\n",
       "the required blasting carried out. Gunpowder and similar\n",
       "explosives do not need to be detonated, and so a simple\n",
       "fuse is used. Electric fuses are much the same as detonators,\n",
       "except that the tube contains gunpowder instead of\n",
       "fulminate of mercury, this powder being ignited through an\n",
       "electrically heated wire in the same way. These electrical\n",

       "vegetation. In spite of the lack of good soil, heat, and\n",

       "slow but constant discharge therefore is probably taking\n",
       "place in the tissues of all plants. Experiments appear to\n",
       "indicate that the upper part of a growing plant is negative,\n",
       "and the lower part positive, and at any rate it is certain that\n",
       "the leaves of a plant give off negative electricity. In dull\n",
       "weather this discharge is at its minimum, but under the\n",
       "influence of bright sunshine it goes on with full vigour. It\n",
       "is not known exactly how this discharge affects the plant,\n",
       "but apparently it assists its development in some way, and\n",
       "there is no doubt that when the discharge is at its maximum\n",
       "the flow of sap is most vigorous. Possibly the electricity\n",
       "helps the plant to assimilate its food, by making this more\n",
       "readily soluble.</p>\n",
       "<p>This being so, a plant requires a regular daily supply of\n",
       "uninterrupted sunshine in order to arrive at its highest\n",

       "periods of bright sunshine, and many other days without\n",
       "any sunshine at all. Now if, on these dull days, we can\n",

       "strengthen to some extent the minute currents passing\n",
       "through the tissues of a plant, the development of this\n",

       "small scale, and much valuable work has been done with\n",
       "them by Professor Priestly and others; but they have the\n",
       "great drawback of being uncertain in working. They are\n",
       "quite satisfactory so long as the atmosphere remains dry,\n",
       "but in damp weather they are often very erratic, and may\n",

       "this reason an induction coil is more suitable for continuous\n",
       "work on an extensive scale.</p>\n",
       "<p>The most satisfactory apparatus for electro-culture is\n",
       "that used in the Lodge-Newman method, designed by Sir\n",
       "Oliver Lodge and his son, working in conjunction with\n",
       "Mr. Newman. This consists of a large induction coil\n",
       "supplied with current from a dynamo driven by a small\n",
       "engine, or from the public mains if available. This coil\n",
       "is fitted with a spark gap, and the high-tension current goes\n",
       "through four or five vacuum valve globes, the invention\n",
       "of Sir Oliver Lodge, which permit the current to pass\n",
       "through them in one direction only. This is necessary\n",
       "because, as we saw in <a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#chapter_VIII\">Chapter VIII</a>., two opposite currents\n",
       "are induced in the secondary winding of the coil, one at the\n",
       "make and the other at the break of the primary circuit.\n",
       "Although the condenser fitted in the base of the coil\n",
       "suppresses to a great extent the current induced on making\n",
       "the circuit, still the current from the coil is not quite\n",
       "uni-directional, but it is made so by the vacuum rectifying\n",
       "valves. These are arranged to pass only the positive\n",
       "current, and this current is led to overhead wires out in the\n",
       "field to be electrified. Lemström used wires at a height of\n",
       "18 inches from the ground, but these were very much in\n",
       "the way, and in the Lodge-Newman system the main wires\n",
       "are carried on large porcelain insulators fixed at the top of\n",
       "poles at a height of about 15 feet. This arrangement\n",
       "allows carting and all other agricultural operations to be\n",
       "carried on as usual. The poles are set round the field,<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_261\">261</span>\n",
       "about one to the acre, and from these main wires finer\n",
       "ones are carried across the field. These wires are placed\n",
       "about 30 feet apart, so that the whole field is covered by a\n",
       "network of wires. The electricity supplied to the wires is\n",
       "at a pressure of about 100,000 volts, and this is constantly\n",
       "being discharged into the air above the plants. It then\n",
       "passes through the plants, and so reaches the earth. This\n",
       "system may be applied also to plants growing in greenhouses,\n",
       "but owing to the confined space, and to the amount\n",
       "of metal about, in the shape of hot-water pipes and wires\n",
       "for supporting plants such as vines and cucumbers, it is\n",
       "difficult to make satisfactory arrangements to produce the\n",

       "<p>The results obtained with this apparatus at Evesham,\n",
       "in Gloucestershire, by Mr. Newman, have been most\n",
       "striking. With wheat, increases of from 20 per cent. to\n",
       "nearly 40 per cent. have been obtained, and the electrified\n",
       "wheat is of better quality than unelectrified wheat grown at\n",
       "the same place, and, apart from electrification, under exactly\n",
       "the same conditions. In some instances the electrified\n",
       "wheat was as much as 8 inches higher than the\n",
       "unelectrified wheat. Mr. Newman believes that by\n",
       "electrification land yielding normally from 30 to 40 bushels\n",
       "of wheat per acre can be made to yield 50 or even 60\n",
       "bushels per acre. With cucumbers under glass increases\n",
       "of 17 per cent. have been obtained, and in the case of\n",
       "strawberries, increases of 36 per cent. with old plants, and\n",
       "80 per cent. with one-year-old plants. In almost every\n",
       "case electrification has produced a marked increase in the\n",
       "crop, and in the few cases where there has been a decrease\n",
       "the crops were ready earlier than the normal. For instance,\n",
       "in one experiment with broad beans a decrease of 15 per\n",
       "cent. resulted, but the beans were ready for picking five\n",
       "days earlier. In another case a decrease of 11½ per cent.<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_262\">262</span>\n",
       "occurred with strawberries, but the fruit was ready for\n",
       "picking some days before the unelectrified fruit, and also\n",
       "was much sweeter. In some of the experiments resulting\n",
       "in a decrease in the yield it is probable that the electrification\n",
       "was overdone, so that the plants were over-stimulated.\n",
       "It seems likely that the best results will be obtained only\n",
       "by adjusting the intensity and the duration of the electrification\n",
       "in accordance with the atmospheric conditions, and\n",

       "<p>Unlike the farmer, the market gardener has to produce\n",
       "one crop after another throughout the year. To make up\n",
       "for the absence of sufficient sunshine he has to resort to\n",
       "“forcing” in many cases, but unfortunately this process,\n",
       "besides being costly, generally results in the production of\n",
       "a crop of inferior quality. Evidently the work of the\n",
       "market gardener would be greatly facilitated by some\n",
       "artificial substitute for sunshine, to keep his plants growing\n",
       "properly in dull weather. In 1880, Sir William Siemens,\n",
       "knowing that the composition of the light of the electric\n",
       "arc was closely similar to that of sunlight, commenced\n",
       "experiments with an arc lamp in a large greenhouse. His\n",
       "idea was to add to the effects of the solar light by using\n",
       "the arc lamp throughout the night. His first efforts were\n",
       "unsuccessful, and he discovered that this was due to the\n",
       "use of the naked light, which apparently contained rays\n",
       "too powerful for the plants. He then passed the light\n",
       "through glass, which filtered out the more powerful rays,\n",
       "and this arrangement was most successful, the plants\n",
       "responding readily to the artificial light. More scientifically\n",
       "planned experiments were carried out at the London\n",
       "Royal Botanic Gardens in 1907, by Mr. B. H. Thwaite,<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_263\">263</span>\n",
       "and these showed that by using the arc lamp for about five\n",
       "hours every night, a great difference between the treated\n",
       "plants and other similar plants grown normally could be\n",
       "produced in less than a month. Other experiments made\n",
       "in the United States with the arc lamp, and also with\n",
       "ordinary electric incandescent lamps, gave similar results,\n",

       "nature.</p>\n",
       "<p>In 1910, Miss E. C. Dudgeon, of Dumfries, commenced\n",
       "a series of experiments with the Cooper-Hewitt mercury\n",
       "vapour lamp. Two greenhouses were employed, one of\n",
       "which was fitted with this lamp. Seeds of various plants\n",
       "were sown in small pots, one pot of each kind being placed\n",
       "in each house. The temperature and other conditions\n",
       "were kept as nearly alike as possible in both houses, and\n",
       "in the experimental house the lamp was kept going for\n",
       "about five hours every night. In every case the seeds in\n",
       "the experimental house germinated several days before\n",
       "those in the other house, and the resulting plants were\n",
       "healthy and robust. Later experiments carried out by\n",
       "Miss Dudgeon with plants were equally successful.</p>\n",
       "<p>From these experiments it appears that the electric arc,\n",
       "and still more the mercury vapour lamp, are likely to prove\n",
       "of great value to the market gardener. As compared with\n",
       "the arc lamp, the mercury vapour lamp has the great\n",
       "advantage of requiring scarcely any attention, and also it\n",
       "uses less current. Unlike the products of ordinary forcing\n",
       "by heat, the plants grown under the influence of the\n",
       "mercury vapour light are quite sturdy, so that they can be\n",
       "planted out with scarcely any “hardening off.” The crop\n",
       "yields too are larger, and of better quality. The wonderful\n",
       "effects produced by the Cooper-Hewitt lamp are\n",
       "certainly not due to heat, for this lamp emits few heat rays.<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_264\">264</span>\n",
       "The results may be due partly to longer hours worked by\n",
       "the plants, but this does not explain the greater accumulation\n",
       "of chlorophyll and stronger development of fibre.</p>\n",
       "<p>Most of us are familiar with the yarn about the poultry\n",
       "keeper who fitted all his nests with trap-doors, so that when\n",
       "a hen laid an egg, the trap-door opened under the weight\n",
       "and allowed the egg to fall through into a box lined with\n",
       "hay. The hen then looked round, and finding no egg, at\n",
       "once set to work to lay another. This in turn dropped,\n",
       "another egg was laid, and so on. It is slightly doubtful\n",
       "whether the modern hen could be swindled in this bare-faced\n",
       "manner, but it is certain that she can be deluded into\n",
       "working overtime. The scheme is absurdly simple.\n",
       "Electric lamps are fitted in the fowl-house, and at sunset\n",
       "the light is switched on. The unsuspecting hens, who are\n",
       "just thinking about retiring for the night, come to the conclusion\n",
       "that the day is not yet over, and so they continue\n",
       "to lay. This is not a yarn, but solid fact, and the increase\n",
       "in the egg yield obtained in this way by different poultry\n",
       "keepers ranges from 10 per cent. upwards. Indeed, one\n",
       "poultry expert claims to have obtained an increase of about\n",
       "40 per cent.</p>\n",
       "<p>The ease with which a uniform temperature can be\n",
       "maintained by electric heating has been utilized in incubator\n",
       "hatching of chickens. By means of a specially designed\n",
       "electric radiator the incubator is kept at the right temperature\n",
       "throughout the hatching period. When the chickens\n",
       "emerge from the eggs they are transferred to another\n",
       "contrivance called a “brooder,” which also is electrically\n",
       "heated, the heat being decreased gradually day by day until\n",
       "the chicks are sturdy enough to do without it. Even at\n",
       "this stage however the chickens do not always escape\n",
       "from the clutches of electricity. Some rearers have\n",
       "adopted the electric light swindle for the youngsters,<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_265\">265</span>\n",
       "switching on the light after the chickens have had a fair\n",

       "this way the chickens are persuaded to consume more food\n",
       "in the twenty-four hours, and the resulting gain in weight\n",
       "is said to be considerable. More interesting than this\n",
       "scheme is the method of rearing chickens under the\n",
       "influence of an electric discharge from wires supplied with\n",
       "high-tension current. Comparative tests show that electrified\n",

       "<p>Possibly the high-tension discharge may turn out to be\n",
       "as beneficial to animals as it has been proved to be for\n",
       "plants, but so far there is little reliable evidence on this\n",
       "point, owing to lack of experimenters. A test carried out\n",
       "in the United States with a flock of sheep is worth\n",

       "large number of turns of thin copper wire. If a certain<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_267\">267</span>\n",
       "section of a pipe is lost, and has to be located, operations\n",
       "are commenced from some fitting known to be connected\n",
       "with it, and from some other fitting which may or may not\n",
       "be connected with the pipe, but which is believed to be so\n",

       "<p>Attempts have been made to detect the proximity of\n",
       "icebergs by noting the variations in the temperature of the\n",
       "water. We naturally should expect the temperature of the\n",
       "water to become lower as we approach a large berg, and\n",
       "this is usually the case. On the other hand, it has been\n",
       "found that in many instances the temperature near an\n",
       "iceberg is quite as high as, and sometimes higher than the\n",
       "average temperature of the ocean. For this reason the\n",

       "the water. Icebergs are formed from fresh water, and as\n",
       "they gradually melt during their southward journey the\n",
       "fresh water mixes with the sea water. Consequently the\n",
       "water around an iceberg is less salt than the water of the\n",

       "measured continuously by very accurate instruments.\n",
       "Variations in the conductivity, indicating corresponding\n",

       "immediately; but before these indications can be relied\n",
       "upon the instrument must be compensated for temperature,\n",
       "because the conductivity of the water increases with a rise,\n",
       "and decreases with a fall in temperature. This compensation\n",
       "is effected by the compound bars of brass and steel\n",
       "shown in the vessel at the right of the figure. These bars\n",
       "are connected with the wheel and disc from which the\n",
       "electrodes are suspended. When the temperature of the\n",
       "water rises, the bars contract, and exert a pull upon the\n",
       "wheel and disc, so that the electrodes are raised slightly in\n",
       "the <span class=\"sans bold\">U</span>-tube. This increases the length of the column of\n",
       "water between the platinum points, and so increases the\n",
       "resistance, or, what amounts to the same thing, lowers the\n",
       "conductivity, in exact proportion to the rise in temperature.\n",
       "Similarly, a fall in temperature lowers the electrodes, and\n",
       "decreases the resistance by shortening the column of water.\n",
       "In this way the conductivity of the water remains constant\n",
       "so far as temperature is concerned, and it varies only with\n",
       "the saltness of the water. Under ordinary conditions a\n",
       "considerable decrease in the salinity of the water indicates\n",
       "the existence of ice in the near neighbourhood, but the\n",
       "geographical position of the ship has to be taken into\n",

       "quantities of fresh water into the ocean, and the resulting\n",

       "<p>Considerable interest was aroused last year by a model\n",
       "of a railway working upon a very remarkable system. This\n",
       "was the invention of Mr. Emile Bachelet, and the model\n",
       "was brought to London from the United States. The main\n",
       "principle upon which the system is based is interesting.\n",
       "About 1884, Professor Elihu Thompson, a famous American\n",
       "scientist, made the discovery that a plate of copper could be\n",
       "attracted or repelled by an electro-magnet. The effects\n",
       "took place at the moment when the magnetism was varied\n",
       "by suddenly switching the current on or off; the copper\n",
       "being repelled when the current was switched on, and\n",
       "attracted when it was switched off. Copper is a non-magnetic\n",
       "substance, and the attraction and repulsion are\n",
       "not ordinary magnetic effects, but are due to currents\n",
       "induced in the copper plate at the instant of producing or\n",
       "destroying the magnetism. The plate is attracted or\n",
       "repelled according to whether these induced currents flow in\n",
       "the same direction as, or in the opposite direction to, the\n",
       "current in the magnet coil. Brass and aluminium plates\n",
       "act in the same way as the copper plate, and the effects are\n",
       "produced equally well by exciting the magnet with alternating\n",
       "current, which, by changing its direction, changes the\n",
       "magnetism also. Of the two effects, the repulsion is\n",
       "much the stronger, especially if the variations in the\n",
       "magnetism take place very rapidly; and if a powerful\n",
       "and rapidly alternating current is used, the plate is repelled\n",
       "so strongly that it remains supported in mid-air above the\n",
       "magnet.</p>\n",
       "<p>This repulsive effect is utilized in the Bachelet system\n",
       "(<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#plate_XV\">Plate XV</a>.). There are no rails in the ordinary sense, and\n",
       "the track is made up of a continuous series of electro-magnets.<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_272\">272</span>\n",
       "The car, which is shaped something like a cigar,\n",
       "has a floor of aluminium, and contains an iron cylinder,\n",
       "and it runs above the line of magnets. Along each side\n",
       "of the track is a channel guide rail, and underneath the car\n",
       "at each end are fixed two brushes with guide pieces, which\n",
       "run in the guide rails. Above the car is a third guide rail,\n",
       "and two brushes with guide pieces fixed on the top of the\n",
       "car, one at each end, run in this overhead rail. These\n",
       "guide rails keep the car in position, and also act as conductors\n",
       "for the current. The repulsive action of the\n",
       "electro-magnets upon the aluminium floor raises the car\n",
       "clear of the track, and keeps it suspended; and while\n",
       "remaining in this mid-air position it is driven, or rather\n",
       "pulled forward, by powerful solenoids, which are supplied\n",
       "with continuous current. We have referred previously to\n",

       "brought about by wireless telegraphy. To-day every\n",
       "warship has its wireless installation. Our cruiser squadrons\n",
       "and destroyer flotillas, ceaselessly patrolling the waters of\n",

       "Even before the actual declaration of war between\n",
       "Great Britain and Germany wireless telegraphy began its\n",
       "work. At the conclusion of the great naval review of\n",
       "July 1914, the Fleet left Portland to disperse as customary\n",
       "for manœuvre leave, but a wireless message was dispatched\n",
       "ordering the Fleet not to disperse. As no state of war\n",
       "then existed, this was a precautionary measure, but subsequent\n",
       "events quickly proved how urgently necessary it\n",
       "had been to keep the Fleet in battle array. Immediately\n",
       "war was declared Great Britain was able to put into the\n",
       "North Sea a fleet which hopelessly outnumbered and outclassed\n",
       "the German battle fleet.</p>\n",
       "<p>At the outset Germany had a number of cruisers in the\n",
       "Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Owing to the vigilance<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_275\">275</span>\n",
       "of our warships these vessels were unable to join the\n",
       "German Home Fleet, and they immediately adopted the\n",
       "rôle of commerce destroyers. In this work they made\n",
       "extensive use of wireless telegraphy to ascertain the whereabouts\n",
       "of British merchant ships, and for a short time they\n",
       "played quite a merry game. Prominent among these\n",
       "raiders was the <i>Emden</i>. It was really astonishing how\n",
       "this cruiser obtained information regarding the sailings of\n",
       "British ships. It is said that on one occasion she called up\n",
       "by wireless a merchant ship, and inquired if the latter had\n",
       "seen anything of a German cruiser. The unsuspecting\n",
       "merchantman replied that there was no such thing as a\n",
       "German warship in the vicinity. “Oh yes, there is,”\n",
       "returned the <i>Emden</i>; “I’m it!” and shortly afterwards she\n",
       "appeared on the horizon, to the great discomfiture of the\n",
       "British skipper. An interesting account of the escape of a\n",
       "British liner from another notorious raider, the <i>Karlsruhe</i>,\n",
       "has been given in the <cite>Nautical Magazine</cite>. The writer\n",
       "says:</p>\n",
       "<p>“I have just returned home after a voyage to South\n",
       "America in one of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company’s\n",
       "cargo boats. When we left Montevideo we heard that\n",
       "France and Germany were at war, and that there was\n",
       "every possibility of Great Britain sending an ultimatum to\n",
       "Germany. We saw several steamers after leaving the\n",
       "port, but could get no information, as few of them were\n",
       "fitted with wireless and passed at some distance off. When\n",
       "about 200 miles east of Rio, our wireless operator overheard\n",
       "some conversation between the German cruiser\n",
       "<i>Karlsruhe</i> and a German merchant ship at anchor in Rio.\n",
       "It was clearly evident that the German merchant ship had\n",
       "no special code, as the conversation was carried on in plain\n",
       "German language, and our operator, who, by the way, was\n",
       "master of several languages, was able to interpret these<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_276\">276</span>\n",
       "messages without the slightest difficulty. It was then that\n",
       "we learned that Great Britain was at war. The German\n",
       "cruiser was inquiring from the German merchant ship what\n",
       "British vessels were leaving Rio, and asking for any information\n",
       "which might be of use. We also picked up some\n",
       "news of German victories in Belgium, which were given\n",
       "out by the German merchant ship. It was clearly evident\n",
       "that the <i>Karlsruhe</i> had information about our ship, and\n",
       "expected us to be in the position she anticipated, for she\n",
       "sent out a signal to us in English, asking us for our latitude\n",
       "and longitude. This our operator, under the instructions\n",
       "of the captain, declined to give. The German operator\n",
       "evidently got furious, as he called us an English ‘swine-hound,’\n",
       "and said, ‘This is a German warship, <i>Karlsruhe</i>;\n",
       "we will you find.’ Undoubtedly he thought he was going\n",
       "to strike terror to our hearts, but he made a mistake.</p>\n",
       "<p>“That night we steamed along without lights, and we\n",
       "knew from the sound of the wireless signals that were\n",
       "being flashed out from the German ship that we were\n",
       "getting nearer and nearer to her. Fortunately for us,\n",
       "about midnight a thick misty rain set in and we passed the\n",
       "German steamer, and so escaped. Our operator said that\n",
       "we could not have been more than 8 or 10 miles away\n",
       "when we passed abeam. Undoubtedly our wireless on\n",
       "this occasion saved us from the danger from which we\n",
       "escaped.”</p>\n",
       "<p>Apparently little is known of the end of the <i>Karlsruhe</i>,\n",
       "but the <i>Emden</i> met with the fate she richly deserved; and\n",
       "fittingly enough, wireless telegraphy, which had enabled\n",
       "her to carry out her marauding exploits, was the means of\n",
       "bringing her to her doom. On 9th November 1914 the\n",
       "<i>Emden</i> anchored off the Cocos-Keeling Islands, a group\n",
       "of coral islets in the Indian Ocean, and landed a party of\n",
       "three officers and forty men to cut the cable and destroy<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_277\">277</span>\n",
       "the wireless station. Before the Germans could get to the\n",
       "station, a wireless message was sent out stating the\n",
       "presence of the enemy warship, and this call was received\n",
       "by the Australian cruisers <i>Melbourne</i> and <i>Sydney</i>. These\n",
       "vessels, which were then only some 50 miles away, were\n",
       "engaged, along with a Japanese cruiser, in escorting transports.\n",
       "The <i>Sydney</i> at once went off at full speed, caught\n",
       "the <i>Emden</i>, and sent her to the bottom after a short but\n",
       "sharp engagement. As the <i>Emden</i> fled at sight of the\n",
       "Australian warship, the landing party had not time to get\n",
       "aboard, and consequently were left behind. They seized\n",
       "an old schooner, provisioned her, and set sail, but what\n",
       "became of them is not known.</p>\n",
       "<p>In land warfare field telegraphs play a very important\n",
       "part; indeed it is certain that without them the vast military\n",

       "The General Headquarters of our army in France is in\n",
       "telegraphic communication not only with neighbouring\n",

       "so that the Headquarters Staff, and through them the\n",

       "along the whole front. The following extract from a letter\n",
       "from an officer, published by <cite>The Times</cite>, gives a remarkably\n",
       "good idea of the work of the signal companies of the\n",

       "provided to keep in constant touch with General Headquarters\n",
       "during the movement. This emergency is met\n",
       "by cable detachments. Each detachment consists of two\n",
       "cable waggons, which usually work in conjunction with one\n",
       "another, one section laying the line whilst the other remains\n",
       "behind to reel up when the line is finished with. A<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_278\">278</span>\n",
       "division is ordered to move quickly to a more tactical\n",
       "position. The end of the cable is connected with the\n",
       "permanent line, which communicates to Army Headquarters,\n",
       "and the cable detachment moves off at the trot; across\n",
       "country, along roads, through villages, and past columns of\n",
       "troops, the white and blue badge of the signal service\n",
       "clears the way. Behind the waggon rides a horseman, who\n",
       "deftly lays the cable in the ditches and hedges out of danger\n",
       "from heavy transport and the feet of tramping infantry,\n",
       "with the aid of a crookstick. Other horsemen are in the\n",
       "rear tying back and making the line safe. On the box of\n",
       "the waggon sits a telegraphist, who is constantly in touch\n",
       "with headquarters as the cable runs swiftly out. An\n",
       "orderly dashes up with an important message; the waggon\n",
       "is stopped, the message dispatched, and on they go again.”</p>\n",
       "<p>Wireless telegraphy too has its part to play in land\n",
       "war, and for field purposes it has certain advantages over\n",
       "telegraphy with wires. Ordinary telegraphic communication\n",
       "is liable to be interrupted by the cutting of the wire by\n",
       "the enemy, or, in spite of every care in laying, by the\n",
       "breaking of the wire by passing cavalry or artillery. No\n",
       "such trouble can occur with wireless telegraphy, and if it\n",
       "becomes necessary to move a wireless station with great\n",
       "rapidity, as for instance on an unexpected advance of the\n",

       "divided amongst four horses. They can be set up in ten\n",
       "minutes by five or six men, and require only two men to\n",

       "more under favourable conditions. The cart sets can be<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_279\">279</span>\n",

       "<p>It is obviously very important that wireless military\n",
       "messages should not be intercepted and read by the enemy,\n",

       "The transmitter and the receiver are arranged to work on\n",
       "three different fixed wave-lengths, the change from one to\n",
       "another being effected quickly by the movement of a three-position\n",

       "sends three or four words on one wave-length, then changes\n",
       "to another, transmits a few words on this, changes the wave-length\n",
       "again, and so on. Each change is accompanied by\n",
       "the sending of a code letter which informs the receiving\n",
       "operator to which wave-length the transmitter is passing.\n",
       "The receiving operator adjusts his switch accordingly, and\n",
       "so he hears the whole message without interruption, the\n",
       "change from one wave-length to another taking only a small\n",
       "fraction of a second. An enemy operator might manage\n",
       "to adjust his wave-length so as to hear two or three words,\n",
       "but the sudden change of wave-length would throw him out\n",
       "of tune, and by the time he had found the new wave-length\n",
       "this would have changed again. Thus he would hear at\n",
       "most only a few disconnected words at intervals, and he\n",
       "would not be able to make head or tail of the message.\n",
       "To provide against the possibility of the three wave-lengths\n",
       "being measured and prepared for, these fixed lengths themselves\n",
       "can be changed, if necessary, many times a day, so\n",

       "<p>The rapid development of aviation during the past few\n",
       "years has drawn attention to the necessity for some means\n",
       "of communication between the land and airships and\n",
       "aeroplanes in flight. At first sight it might appear that\n",
       "wireless telegraphy could be used for this purpose without\n",
       "any trouble, but experience has shown that there are\n",
       "certain difficulties in the way, especially with regard to\n",
       "aeroplanes. The chief difficulty with aeroplanes lies in the\n",
       "aerial. This must take the form either of a long trailing\n",
       "wire or of fixed wires running between the planes and the\n",
       "tail. A trailing wire is open to the objection that it is\n",
       "liable to get mixed up with the propeller, besides which it\n",
       "appears likely to hamper to some slight extent the movements\n",
       "of a small and light machine. A fixed aerial between\n",
       "planes and tail avoids these difficulties, but on the other\n",
       "hand its wave-length is bound to be inconveniently small.\n",
       "The heavy and powerful British military aeroplanes\n",
       "apparently use a trailing wire of moderate length, carried\n",
       "in a special manner so as to clear the propeller, but few\n",
       "details are available at present. A further trouble with\n",
       "aeroplanes lies in the tremendous noise made by the\n",
       "engine, which frequently makes it quite impossible to hear\n",
       "incoming signals; and the only way of getting over this\n",
       "difficulty appears to be for the operator to wear some sort\n",
       "of sound-proof head-gear. Signals have been transmitted\n",
       "from an aeroplane in flight up to distances of 40 or 50 miles\n",
       "quite successfully, but the reception of signals by aeroplanes\n",
       "is not so satisfactory, except for comparatively short distances.\n",
       "Although few particulars have been published\n",
       "regarding the work of the British aeroplanes in France, it\n",
       "seems evident that wireless telegraphy is in regular use.\n",
       "In addition to their value as scouts, our aeroplanes appear\n",
       "to be extremely useful for the direction of heavy artillery\n",
       "fire, using wireless to tell the gunners where each shell falls,\n",
       "until the exact range is obtained. In the case of airships\n",
       "the problem of wireless communication is much simpler.\n",
       "A trailing wire presents no difficulties, and on account of\n",
       "their great size much more powerful sets of apparatus can\n",
       "be carried. The huge German Zeppelin airships have a\n",
       "long freely-floating aerial consisting of a wire which can be\n",
       "wound in or let out as required, its full length being about\n",
       "750 feet. The total weight of the apparatus is nearly\n",
       "300 lb., and the transmitting range is said to be from\n",
       "about 120 to 200 miles.</p>\n",
       "<p>Electricity is used in the navy for a great variety of\n",
       "purposes besides telegraphy. Our battleships are lighted\n",
       "by electricity, which is generated at a standard pressure of\n",
       "220 volts. This current is transformed down for the\n",
       "searchlights, and also for the intricate systems of telephone,\n",
       "alarm, and firing circuits. The magazines containing the\n",
       "deadly cordite are maintained at a constant temperature of\n",
       "70° F. by special refrigerating machinery driven by electricity,<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_282\">282</span>\n",
       "and the numerous fans for ventilating the different parts of\n",
       "the ship are also electrically driven. Electric power is used\n",

       "pumps, whether for drainage, fire extinction, or raising\n",
       "fresh water from the tanks, and for the mechanism for\n",
       "operating boats and torpedo nets. The mechanism for\n",
       "manipulating the great guns and their ammunition is\n",
       "hydraulic. Electricity was tried for this purpose on the\n",
       "battle cruiser <i>Invincible</i>, but was abandoned in favour of\n",
       "hydraulic power. But though electricity is apparently out of\n",
       "favour in this department, it takes an extremely important\n",

       "being such as could not be carried out by hydraulic power.</p>\n",
       "<p>The guns are controlled and fired from what is known\n",
       "as the fire-control room, which is situated in the interior of\n",
       "the ship, quite away from the guns themselves. The\n",
       "range-finder, from his perch up in the gigantic mast,\n",
       "watches an enemy warship as she looms on the horizon,\n",
       "and when she comes within range he estimates her distance\n",
       "by means of instruments of wonderful precision. He then\n",
       "telephones to the fire-control room, giving this distance,\n",
       "and also the enemy’s speed and course. The officer in\n",
       "charge of the fire-control room calculates the elevation of\n",
       "the gun required for this distance, and decides upon the\n",
       "instant at which the gun must be fired. A telephoned\n",
       "order goes to the gun-turret, and the guns are brought to\n",
       "bear upon the enemy, laid at the required elevation, and\n",
       "sighted. At the correct instant the fire-control officer\n",
       "switches on an electric current to the gun, which fires a\n",
       "small quantity of highly explosive material, and this in\n",
       "turn fires the main charge of cordite. The effect of the\n",
       "shell is watched intently from the fire-control top, up above\n",
       "the range-finder, and if, as is very likely, this first shell\n",
       "falls short of, or overshoots the mark, an estimate of the<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_283\">283</span>\n",
       "amount of error is communicated to the fire-control room.\n",
       "Due corrections are then made, the gun is laid at a slightly\n",

       "with unerring accuracy.</p>\n",
       "<p>The range of movement, horizontal and vertical, of\n",
       "modern naval guns is so great that it is possible for two\n",
       "guns to be in such relative positions that the firing of one\n",
       "would damage the other. To guard against a disaster of\n",
       "this kind fixed stops are used, supplemented by ingenious\n",
       "automatic alarms. The alarm begins to sound as soon as\n",
       "any gun passes into a position in which it could damage\n",
       "another gun, and it goes on sounding until the latter gun\n",
       "is moved out of the danger line.</p>\n",

       "mines has been brought to our notice in very forcible\n",

       "submarine mine is not a recent introduction. It is difficult\n",
       "to say exactly when mines were first brought into use, but\n",
       "at any rate we know that they were employed by Russia\n",
       "during the Crimean War, apparently with little success.\n",
       "The first really successful use of mines occurred in the\n",
       "American Civil War, when the Confederates sank a number\n",
       "of vessels by means of them. This practical demonstration\n",
       "of their possibilities did not pass unnoticed by European\n",
       "nations, and in the Franco-German War we find that mines\n",
       "were used for harbour defence by both belligerents. It is\n",
       "doubtful whether either nation derived much benefit from\n",
       "its mines, and indeed as the war progressed Germany\n",
       "found that the principal result of her mining operations was\n",
       "to render her harbours difficult and dangerous to her own\n",
       "shipping. Much greater success attended the use of mines\n",
       "in the Russo-Japanese War, but all previous records shrink\n",
       "into insignificance when compared with the destruction\n",
       "wrought by mines in the present great conflict.</p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_284\">284</span></p>\n",
       "<p>Submarine mines may be divided into two classes;\n",
       "those for harbour defence, and those for use in the open\n",
       "sea. Harbour defence mines are almost invariably electrically\n",
       "controlled; that is, they are connected with the shore\n",
       "by means of a cable, and fired by an electric impulse sent\n",
       "along that cable. In one system of control the moment of\n",
       "firing is determined entirely by observers on shore, who,\n",
       "aided by special optical instruments, are able to tell exactly\n",
       "when a vessel is above any particular mine. The actual\n",
       "firing is carried out by depressing a key which completes\n",
       "an electric circuit, thus sending a current along the cable\n",
       "to actuate the exploding mechanism inside the mine. A\n",
       "hostile ship therefore would be blown up on arriving at the\n",
       "critical position, while a friendly vessel would be allowed\n",
       "to pass on in safety. In this system of control there is no\n",
       "contact between the vessel and the mine, the latter being\n",
       "well submerged or resting on the sea floor, so that the\n",
       "harbour is not obstructed in any way. This is a great\n",
       "advantage, but against it must be set possible failure of the\n",
       "defence at a critical moment owing to thick weather, which\n",
       "of course interferes seriously with the careful observation\n",
       "of the mine field necessary for accurate timing of the explosions.\n",
       "This difficulty may be surmounted by a contact\n",
       "system of firing. In this case the mines are placed so near\n",
       "the surface as to make contact with vessels passing over\n",
       "them. The observers on shore are informed of the contact\n",
       "by means of an electric impulse automatically transmitted\n",
       "along the cable, so that they are independent of continuous\n",
       "visual observation of the mined area. As in the previous\n",
       "system, the observers give the actual firing impulse. The\n",
       "drawback to this method is the necessity for special pilotage\n",
       "arrangements for friendly ships in order to avoid unnecessary\n",
       "striking of the mines, which are liable to have their\n",
       "mechanism deranged by constant blows. If the harbour or<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_285\">285</span>\n",
       "channel can be closed entirely to friendly shipping, the\n",
       "observers may be dispensed with, their place being taken\n",
       "by automatic electric apparatus which fires at once any mine\n",
       "struck by a vessel.</p>\n",
       "<p>Shore-controlled mines are excellent for harbour\n",
       "defence, and a carefully distributed mine-field, backed by\n",

       "may be regarded as almost impenetrable. A strong fleet\n",
       "might conceivably force its way through, but in so doing it\n",
       "would sustain tremendous losses; and as these losses would\n",
       "be quite out of proportion to any probable gains, such an\n",
       "attempt is not likely to be made except as a last resort.</p>\n",
       "<p>For use in the open sea a different type of mine is\n",
       "required. This must be quite self-contained and automatic\n",
       "in action, exploding when struck by a passing vessel. The\n",
       "exploding mechanism may take different forms. The blow\n",
       "given by a ship may be made to withdraw a pin, thus\n",
       "releasing a sort of plunger, which, actuated by a powerful\n",
       "spring, detonates the charge. A similar result is obtained\n",
       "by the use of a suspended weight, in place of plunger and\n",
       "spring. Still another form of mine is fired electrically by\n",
       "means of a battery, the circuit of which is closed automatically\n",

       "the mines are run along rails to the stern, and so overboard.\n",

       "<p>From the earliest days of electrical science theories of\n",

       "and development of these theories, and the constant substitution\n",

       "known as the <em>electron</em> theory of electricity.</p>\n",
       "<p>We have referred already, in <a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#chapter_XXIV\">Chapter XXIV</a>., to atoms\n",
       "and electrons. All matter is believed to be constituted\n",
       "of minute particles called “atoms.” These atoms are so\n",
       "extremely small that they are quite invisible, being far\n",
       "beyond the range of the most powerful microscope; and\n",
       "their diameter has been estimated at somewhere about one<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_288\">288</span>\n",
       "millionth of a millimetre. Up to a few years ago the atom\n",
       "was believed to be quite indivisible, but it has been proved\n",
       "beyond doubt that this is not the case. An atom may be\n",
       "said to consist of two parts, one much larger than the\n",
       "other. The smaller part is negatively electrified, and is\n",
       "the same in all atoms; while the larger part is positively\n",
       "electrified, and varies according to the nature of the atom.\n",
       "The small negatively electrified portion of the atom consists of\n",
       "particles called “electrons,” and these electrons are believed\n",
       "to be indivisible units or atoms of negative electricity. To\n",
       "quote Professor Fleming: “An atom of matter in its neutral\n",
       "condition has been assumed to consist of an outer shell or\n",
       "envelope of negative electrons associated with some core or\n",
       "matrix which has an opposite electrical quality, such that if\n",
       "an electron is withdrawn from the atom the latter is left\n",
       "positively electrified.”</p>\n",
       "<p>The electrons in an atom are not fixed, but move with\n",
       "great velocity, in definite orbits. They repel one another,\n",
       "and are constantly endeavouring to fly away from the atom,\n",
       "but they are held in by the attraction of the positive core.\n",
       "So long as nothing occurs to upset the constitution of the\n",
       "atom, a state of equilibrium is maintained and the atom is\n",
       "electrically neutral; but immediately the atom is broken up\n",
       "by the action of an external force of some kind, one or\n",
       "more electrons break their bonds and fly away to join some\n",
       "other atom. An atom which has lost some of its electrons\n",
       "is no longer neutral, but is electro-positive; and similarly,\n",
       "an atom which has gained additional electrons is electro-negative.\n",
       "Electrons, or atoms of negative electricity, can\n",
       "be isolated from atoms of matter, as in the case of the\n",
       "stream of electrons proceeding from the cathode of a vacuum\n",
       "tube. So far, however, it has been found impossible to\n",
       "isolate corresponding atoms of positive electricity.</p>\n",
       "<p>From these facts it appears that we must regard a<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_289\">289</span>\n",
       "positively charged body as possessing a deficiency of\n",
       "electrons, and a negatively charged body as possessing an\n",
       "excess of electrons. In <a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"#chapter_I\">Chapter I</a>. we spoke of the\n",
       "electrification of sealing-wax or glass rods by friction, and\n",
       "we saw that according to the nature of the substance used\n",
       "as the rubber, the rods were either positively or negatively\n",
       "electrified. Apparently, when we rub a glass rod with a\n",
       "piece of silk, the surface atoms of each substance are\n",
       "disturbed, and a certain number of electrons leave the glass\n",
       "atoms, and join the silk atoms. The surface atoms of the\n",
       "glass, previously neutral, are now electro-positive through\n",
       "the loss of electrons; and the surface atoms of the silk,\n",
       "also previously neutral, are now electro-negative through\n",
       "the additional electrons received from the glass atoms.\n",
       "As the result we find the glass to be positively, and silk to\n",
       "be negatively electrified. On the other hand, if we rub the\n",
       "glass with fur, a similar atomic disturbance and consequent\n",
       "migration of electrons takes place, but this time the glass\n",
       "receives electrons instead of parting with them. In this case\n",
       "the glass becomes negatively, and the fur positively electrified.\n",
       "The question now arises, why is the movement of the electrons\n",
       "away from the glass in the first instance, and toward it in\n",
       "the second? To understand this we may make use of a\n",
       "simple analogy. If we place in contact two bodies, one hot\n",
       "and the other cold, the hot body gives up some of its heat\n",
       "to the cold body; but if we place in contact with the hot\n",
       "body another body which is still hotter, then the hot body\n",
       "receives heat instead of parting with it. In a somewhat\n",
       "similar manner an atom is able to give some of its electrons\n",
       "to another atom which, in comparison with it, is deficient in\n",
       "electrons; and at the same time it is able to receive electrons\n",
       "from another atom which, compared with it, has an\n",
       "excess of electrons. Thus we may assume that the glass\n",
       "atoms have an excess of electrons as compared with<span class=\"pagenum\" id=\"Page_290\">290</span>\n",
       "silk atoms, and a deficiency in electrons as compared with\n",
       "fur atoms.</p>\n",
       "<p>A current of electricity is believed to be nothing more\n",
       "or less than a stream of electrons, set in motion by the\n",
       "application of an electro-motive force. We have seen that\n",
       "some substances are good conductors of electricity, while\n",
       "others are bad conductors or non-conductors. In order to\n",
       "produce an electric current, that is a current of electrons, it\n",
       "is evidently necessary that the electrons should be free to\n",
       "move. In good conductors, which are mostly metals, it is\n",
       "believed that the electrons are able to move from atom to\n",
       "atom without much hindrance, while in a non-conductor\n",
       "their movements are hampered to such an extent that inter-atomic\n",
       "exchange of electrons is almost impossible. Speaking on\n",
       "this point, Professor Fleming says: “There may be (in\n",
       "a good conductor) a constant decomposition and recomposition\n",
       "of atoms taking place, and any given electron so to\n",
       "speak flits about, now forming part of one atom and now of\n",
       "another, and anon enjoying a free existence. It resembles\n",
       "a person visiting from house to house, forming a unit in\n",
       "different households, and, in between, being a solitary\n",
       "person in the street. In non-conductors, on the other hand,\n",

       "further, that the sodium atom loses an electron, while the\n",
       "chlorine atom gains one. These atoms have the power of\n",
       "travelling about through the solution, and they are called\n",
       "<em>ions</em>, which means “wanderers.” An ordinary atom is unable\n",

       "<p>Returning to the voltaic cell, we may imagine that the\n",
       "atoms of the zinc which are immersed in the acid are trying\n",
       "to turn themselves into ions, so that they can travel through\n",
       "the solution. In order to do this each atom parts with two\n",
       "electrons, and these electrons try to attach themselves to\n",
       "the next atom. This atom however already has two\n",

       "electron stream in a permanent magnet however is not\n",
       "quite the same as the electron stream in a wire conveying a\n",

       "necessary conditions for the production of a magnetic field,\n",
       "that is, a constant stream of electrons; but one important\n",
       "thing is still lacking. In an unmagnetized piece of steel the\n",
       "atoms are not arranged symmetrically, so that the orbits of\n",

       "because the different streams are not working in unison and\n",
       "adding together their forces. In fact they are upsetting\n",
       "and neutralizing each other’s efforts. By stroking the piece\n",
       "of steel with a magnet, or by surrounding it by a coil of\n",
       "wire conveying a current, the atoms are turned so that their\n",
       "electron orbits all lie in the same plane. The electron\n",
       "streams now all work in unison, their magnetic effects are\n",
       "added together, and we get a strong magnetic field as the\n",

       "besides iron and steel show magnetic effects, and this is what\n",
       "we should expect, as the electron movement is common to\n",
       "all atoms. None of these substances is equal to iron\n",

       " 'Although the science of electricity is of comparatively\\nrecent date, electricity itself has existed from the beginning\\nof the world. There can be no doubt that man’s introduction\\nto electricity was brought about through the\\nmedium of the thunderstorm, and from very early times\\ncome down to us records of the terror inspired by thunder\\nand lightning, and of the ways in which the ancients tried\\nto account for the phenomena. Even to-day, although we\\nknow what lightning is and how it is produced, a severe\\nthunderstorm fills us with a certain amount of awe, if not\\nfear; and we can understand what a terrifying experience\\nit must have been to the ancients, who had none of our\\nknowledge.',\n",
       " 'These early people had simple minds, and from our\\npoint of view they had little intelligence; but they possessed\\na great deal of curiosity. They were just as anxious to\\nexplain things as we are, and so they were not content\\nuntil they had invented an explanation of lightning and\\nthunder. Their favourite way of accounting for anything\\nthey did not understand was to make up a sort of romance\\nabout it. They believed that the heavens were inhabited\\nby various gods, who showed their pleasure or anger by2\\nsigns, and so they naturally concluded that thunder was\\nthe voice of angry gods, and lightning the weapon with\\nwhich they struck down those who had displeased them.\\nPrayers and sacrifices were therefore offered to the gods, in\\nthe hope of appeasing their wrath.',\n",
       " 'Greek and Roman mythology contains many references\\nto thunder and lightning. For instance, we read about\\nthe great god Zeus, who wielded thunder-bolts which had\\nbeen forged in underground furnaces by the giant Cyclops.\\nThere was no doubt that the thunder-bolts were made in\\nthis way, because one only had to visit a volcano in order\\nto see the smoke from the furnace, and hear the rumbling\\necho of the far-off hammering. Then we are told the\\ntragic story of Phaeton, son of the Sun-god. This youth,\\nlike many others since his time, was daring and venturesome,\\nand imagined that he could do things quite as well\\nas his father. On one occasion he tried to drive his father’s\\nchariot, and, as might have been expected, it got beyond\\nhis control, and came dangerously near the Earth. The\\nland was scorched, the oceans were dried up, and the whole\\nEarth was threatened with utter destruction. In order to\\nprevent such a frightful catastrophe, Jupiter, the mighty\\nlord of the heavens, hurled a thunder-bolt at Phaeton, and\\nstruck him from the chariot into the river Po. A whole\\nbook could be written about these ancient legends concerning\\nthe thunderstorm, but, interesting as they are, they\\nhave no scientific value, and many centuries were to elapse\\nbefore the real nature of lightning was understood.',\n",
       " 'In order to trace the first glimmerings of electrical\\nknowledge we must leave the thunderstorm and pass on to\\nmore trivial matters. On certain sea-coasts the ancients\\nfound a transparent yellow substance capable of taking a\\nhigh polish, and much to be desired as an ornament; and\\nabout 600 years B.C. it was discovered that this substance,3\\nwhen rubbed, gained the power of drawing to it bits of\\nstraw, feathers, and other light bodies. This discovery is\\ngenerally credited to a Greek philosopher named Thales,\\n941–563 B.C., and it must be regarded as the first step\\ntowards the foundation of electrical science. The yellow\\nsubstance was amber. We now know it to be simply a\\nsort of fossilized resin, but the Greeks gave it a much more\\nromantic origin. When Phaeton’s rashness brought him\\nto an untimely end, his sorrowing sisters, the Heliades,\\nwere changed into poplar trees, and their tears into amber.\\nAmongst the names given to the Sun-god was Alector,\\nwhich means the shining one, and so the tears of the\\nHeliades came to have the name Electron, or the shining\\nthing. Unlike most of the old legends, this story of the\\nfate of the Sun-maidens is of great importance to us, for\\nfrom the word “electron” we get the name Electricity.',\n",
       " 'Thales and his contemporaries seem to have made no\\nserious attempts to explain the attraction of the rubbed\\namber, and indeed so little importance was attached to the\\ndiscovery that it was completely forgotten. About 321 B.C.\\none Theophrastus found that a certain mineral called\\n“lyncurium” gained attractive powers when rubbed, but\\nagain little attention was paid to the matter, and astonishing\\nas it may seem, no further progress worth mention was\\nmade until towards the close of the sixteenth century, when\\nDoctor Gilbert of Colchester began to experiment seriously.\\nThis man was born about 1543, and took his degree of\\ndoctor of medicine at Cambridge in 1569. He was very\\nsuccessful in his medical work, and became President of the\\nCollege of Physicians, and later on physician to Queen\\nElizabeth. He had a true instinct for scientific research,\\nand was not content to accept statements on the authority\\nof others, but tested everything for himself. He found\\nthat sulphur, resin, sealing-wax, and many other substances4\\nbehaved like amber when rubbed, but he failed to get any\\nresults from certain other substances, such as the metals.\\nHe therefore called the former substances “electrics,” and\\nthe latter “anelectrics,” or non-electrics. His researches\\nwere continued by other investigators, and from him dates\\nthe science of electricity.',\n",
       " 'Leaving historical matters for the present, we will\\nexamine the curious power which is gained by substances\\nas the result of rubbing. Amber is not always obtainable,\\nand so we will use in its place a glass\\nrod and a stick of sealing-wax. If the\\nglass rod is rubbed briskly with a dry\\nsilk handkerchief, and then held close\\nto a number of very small bits of paper,\\nthe bits are immediately drawn to the\\nrod, and the same thing occurs if the\\nstick of sealing-wax is substituted for\\nthe glass. This power of attraction is\\ndue to the presence of a small charge\\nof electricity on the rubbed glass and\\nsealing-wax, or in other words, the two\\nsubstances are said to be electrified.\\nBits of paper are unsatisfactory for careful\\nexperimenting, and instead of them\\nwe will use the simple piece of apparatus shown in Fig. 1.\\nThis consists of a ball of elder pith, suspended from a glass\\nsupport by means of a silk thread. If now we repeat our\\nexperiments with the electrified glass or sealing-wax we\\nfind that the little ball is attracted in the same way as the\\nbits of paper. But if we look carefully we shall notice that\\nattraction is not the only effect, for as soon as the ball\\ntouches the electrified body it is driven away or repelled.\\nNow let us suspend, by means of a thread, a glass rod\\nwhich has been electrified by rubbing it with silk, and bring5\\nnear it in turn another silk-rubbed glass rod and a stick of\\nsealing-wax rubbed with flannel. The two glass rods are\\nfound to repel one another, whereas the sealing-wax attracts\\nthe glass. If the experiment is repeated with a suspended\\nstick of sealing-wax rubbed with flannel, the glass and the\\nsealing-wax attract each other, but the two sticks of wax\\nrepel one another. Both glass and sealing-wax are\\nelectrified, as may be seen by bringing them near the pith\\nball, but there must be some difference between them as\\nwe get attraction in one case and repulsion in the other.',\n",
       " 'The explanation is that the electric charges on the silk-rubbed\\nglass and on the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax are of\\ndifferent kinds, the former being called positive, and the\\nlatter negative. Bodies with similar charges, such as the\\ntwo glass rods, repel one another; while bodies with unlike\\ncharges, such as the glass and the sealing-wax, attract each\\nother. We can now see why the pith ball was first\\nattracted and then repelled. To start with, the ball was\\nnot electrified, and was attracted when the rubbed glass or\\nsealing-wax was brought near it. When however the\\nball touched the electrified body it received a share of the\\nlatter’s electricity, and as similar charges repel one another,\\nthe ball was driven away.',\n",
       " 'The kind of electricity produced depends not only on\\nthe substance rubbed, but also on the material used as the\\nrubber. For instance, we can give glass a negative charge\\nby rubbing it with flannel, and sealing-wax becomes\\npositively charged when rubbed with silk. The important\\npoint to remember is that there are only two kinds of\\nelectricity, and that every substance electrified by rubbing\\nis charged either positively, like the silk-rubbed glass, or\\nnegatively, like the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax.',\n",
       " 'If we try to electrify a metal rod by holding it in the\\nhand and rubbing it, we get no result, but if we fasten to6\\nthe metal a handle of glass, and hold it by this while\\nrubbing, we find that it becomes electrified in the same way\\nas the glass rod or the sealing-wax. Substances such as\\nglass do not allow electricity to pass along them, so that in\\nrubbing a glass rod the part rubbed becomes charged, and\\nthe electricity stays there, being unable to spread to the\\nother parts of the rod. Substances such as metals allow\\nelectricity to pass easily, so that when a metal rod is\\nrubbed electricity is produced, but it immediately spreads\\nover the whole rod, reaches the hand, and escapes. If we\\nwish the metal to retain its charge we must provide it with\\na handle of glass or of some other material which does not\\nallow electricity to pass. Dr. Gilbert did not know this,\\nand so he came to the conclusion that metals were non-electrics,\\nor could not be electrified.',\n",
       " 'Substances which allow electricity to pass freely are\\ncalled conductors, and those which do not are called non-conductors;\\nwhile between the two extremes are many\\nsubstances which are called partial conductors. It may be\\nsaid here that no substance is quite perfect in either respect,\\nfor all conductors offer some resistance to the passage of\\nelectricity, while all non-conductors possess some conducting\\npower. Amongst conductors are metals, acids, water,\\nand the human body; cotton, linen, and paper are partial\\nconductors; and air, resin, silk, glass, sealing-wax, and\\ngutta-percha are non-conductors. When a conductor is\\nguarded by a non-conductor so that its electricity cannot\\nescape, it is said to be insulated, from Latin, insula, an\\nisland; and non-conductors are also called “insulators.”',\n",
       " 'So far we have mentioned only the electric charge\\nproduced on the substance rubbed, but the material used as\\nrubber also becomes electrified. The two charges, however,\\nare not alike, but one is always positive and the other\\nnegative. For instance, if glass is rubbed with silk, the7\\nglass receives a positive, and the silk a negative charge.\\nIt also can be shown that the two opposite charges are\\nalways equal in quantity.',\n",
       " 'The two kinds of electricity are generally represented\\nby the signs + and -, the former standing for positive\\nand the latter for negative electricity.',\n",
       " 'The electricity produced by rubbing, or friction, is\\nknown as Static Electricity; that is, electricity in a state of\\nrest, as distinguished from electricity in motion, or current\\nelectricity. The word static is derived from a Greek word\\nmeaning to stand. At the same time it must be understood\\nthat this electricity of friction is at rest only in the\\nsense that it is a prisoner, unable to move. When we\\nproduce a charge of static electricity on a glass rod, by\\nrubbing it, the electricity would escape fast enough if it\\ncould. It has only two possible ways of escape, along the\\nrod and through the air, and as both glass and air are non-conductors\\nit is obliged to remain at rest where it was\\nproduced. On the other hand, as we have seen, the\\nelectricity produced by rubbing a metal rod which is not\\nprotected by an insulating handle escapes instantly, because\\nthe metal is a good conductor.',\n",
       " 'When static electricity collects in sufficient quantities\\nit discharges itself in the form of a bright spark, and we\\nshall speak of these sparks in Chapter III. Static electricity\\nis of no use for doing useful work, such as ringing bells or\\ndriving motors, and in fact, except for scientific purposes,\\nit is more of a nuisance than a help. It collects almost\\neverywhere, and its power of attraction makes it very\\ntroublesome at times. In the processes of textile manufacture\\nstatic electricity is produced in considerable\\nquantities, and it makes its presence known by causing the\\nthreads to stick together in the most annoying fashion. In\\nprinting rooms too it plays pranks, making the sheets of8\\npaper stick together so that the printing presses have to be\\nstopped.',\n",
       " 'Curiously enough, static electricity has been detected in\\nthe act of interfering with the work of its twin brother,\\ncurrent electricity. A little while ago it was noticed that\\nthe electric incandescent lamps in a certain building were\\nlasting only a very short time, the filaments being found\\nbroken after comparatively little use. Investigations\\nshowed that the boy was in the habit of dusting the lamp\\nglobes with a feather duster. The friction set up in this\\nway produced charges of electricity on the glass, and this\\nhad the effect of breaking the filaments. When this\\nmethod of dusting was discontinued the trouble ceased, and\\nthe lamps lasted their proper number of hours.',\n",
       " 'The amount of electricity produced by the rubbing of glass\\nor sealing-wax rods is very small, and experimenters soon\\nfelt the need of apparatus to produce larger quantities. In\\n1675 the first electrical machine was made by Otto von\\nGuericke, the inventor of the air-pump. His machine consisted\\nof a globe of sulphur fixed on a spindle, and rotated\\nwhile the hands were pressed against it to provide the\\nnecessary friction. Globes and cylinders of glass soon\\nreplaced the sulphur globe, and the friction was produced\\nby cushions instead of by the hands. Still later, revolving\\nplates of glass were employed. These machines worked\\nwell enough in a dry atmosphere, but were very troublesome\\nin wet weather, and they are now almost entirely\\nsuperseded by what are known as influence machines.',\n",
       " 'In order to understand the working of influence\\nmachines, it is necessary to have a clear idea of what is\\nmeant by the word influence as used in an electrical sense.\\nIn the previous chapter we saw that a pith ball was\\nattracted by an electrified body, and that when the ball\\ntouched that body it received a charge of electricity.\\nWe now have to learn that one body can receive a charge\\nfrom another body without actual contact, by what is called\\n“influence,” or electro-static induction. In Fig. 2 is seen a\\nsimple arrangement for showing this influence or induction.\\nA is a glass ball, and BC a piece of metal, either solid or10\\nhollow, made somewhat in the shape of a sausage, and\\ninsulated by means of its glass support. Three pairs of\\npith balls are suspended from BC as shown. If A is\\nelectrified positively, and brought near BC, the pith balls\\nat B and C repel one another, showing that the ends of\\nBC are electrified. No repulsion takes place between the\\ntwo pith balls at the middle, indicating that this part of\\nBC is not electrified. If the charges at B and C are tested\\nthey are found to be of opposite kinds, that at B being\\nnegative, and that at C positive. Thus it appears that\\nthe positive charge on A has attracted a negative charge\\nto B, and repelled a positive one to C. If A is taken\\naway, the two opposite charges on BC unite and neutralise\\none another, and BC is left in its original uncharged condition,\\nwhile A is found to have lost none of its own charge.\\nIf BC is made in two parts, and if these are separated while\\nunder the influence of A, the two charges cannot unite\\nwhen A is removed, but remain each on its own half of\\nBC. In this experiment A is said to have induced electrification\\non BC. Induction will take place across a considerable\\ndistance, and it is not stopped by the interposition\\nof obstacles such as a sheet of glass.',\n",

One half of the ball is therefore\\nattracted and the other half repelled, but as the attracted\\nhalf is the nearer, the attraction is stronger than the repulsion,\\nand so the ball moves towards the rod.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 3 shows an appliance for obtaining strong charges\\nof electricity by influence or induction. It is called the\\nelectrophorus, the name coming from two Greek words,\\nelectron, amber, and phero,\\nI yield or bear; and it was\\ndevised in 1775 by Volta, an\\nItalian professor of physics.\\nThe apparatus consists of a\\nround cake, A, of some\\nresinous material contained\\nin a metal dish, and a round\\ndisc of metal, B, of slightly\\nsmaller diameter, fitted with\\nan insulating handle. A simple electrophorus may be\\nmade by filling with melted sealing-wax the lid of a\\nround tin, the disc being made of a circular piece of\\ncopper or brass, a little smaller than the lid, fastened to\\nthe end of a stick of sealing-wax. To use the electrophorus,\\nthe sealing-wax is electrified negatively by rubbing\\nit with flannel. The metal disc is then placed on the\\nsealing-wax, touched for an instant with the finger, and\\nlifted away. The disc is now found to be electrified\\npositively, and it may be discharged and the process repeated\\nmany times without recharging the sealing-wax.\\nThe charge on the latter is not used up in the process,12\\nbut it gradually leaks away, and after a time it has to\\nbe renewed.',\n",
       " 'The theory of the electrophorus is easy to understand\\nfrom what we have already learnt about influence. When\\nthe disc B is placed on the charged cake A, the two surfaces\\nare really in contact at only three or four points,\\nbecause neither of them is a true plane; so that on the\\nwhole the disc and the cake are like A and BC in Fig. 2,\\nonly much closer together. The negative charge on\\nA acts by induction\\non the disc B, attracting\\na positive charge\\nto the under side, and\\nrepelling a negative\\ncharge to the upper\\nside. When the disc\\nis touched, the negative\\ncharge on the\\nupper side escapes, but\\nthe positive charge\\nremains, being as it\\nwere held fast by the\\nattraction of the negative\\ncharge on A. If\\nthe disc is now raised, the positive charge is no longer\\nbound on the under side, and it therefore spreads over\\nboth surfaces, remaining there because its escape is cut\\noff by the insulating handle.',\n",
       " 'We may now try to understand the working of influence\\nmachines, which are really mechanically worked electrophori.\\nThere are various types of such machines, but the\\none in most general use in this country is that known as\\nthe Wimshurst machine, Fig. 4, and we will therefore\\nconfine ourselves to this. It consists of two circular plates13\\nof varnished glass or of ebonite, placed close together and\\nso geared that they rotate in opposite directions. On the\\nouter surfaces of the plates are cemented sectors of metal\\nfoil, at equal distances apart. Each plate has the same\\nnumber of sectors, so that at any given moment the sectors\\non one plate are exactly opposite those on the other.\\nAcross the outer surface of each plate is fixed a rod of\\nmetal carrying at its ends light tinsel brushes, which are\\nadjusted to touch the sectors as they pass when the plates\\nare rotated. These rods are placed at an angle to each\\nother of from sixty to ninety degrees, and the brushes are\\ncalled neutralizing brushes. The machine is now complete\\nfor generating purposes, but in order to collect the electricity\\ntwo pairs of insulated metal combs are provided, one pair\\nat each end of the horizontal diameter, with the teeth\\npointing inward towards the plates, but not touching them.\\nThe collecting combs are fitted with adjustable discharging\\nrods terminating in round knobs.',\n",
       " 'The principle upon which the machine works will be\\nbest understood by reference to Fig. 5. In this diagram\\nthe inner circle represents the front plate, with neutralizing\\nbrushes A and B, and the outer one represents the back\\nplate, with brushes C and D. The sectors are shown\\nheavily shaded. E and F are the pairs of combs, and the\\nplates rotate in the direction of the arrows. Let us suppose\\none of the sectors at the top of the back plate to have a\\nslight positive charge. As the plates rotate this sector will\\ncome opposite to a front plate sector touched by brush A,\\nand it will induce a slight negative charge on the latter\\nsector, at the same time repelling a positive charge along\\nthe rod to the sector touched by brush B. The two sectors\\ncarrying the induced charges now move on until opposite\\nback plate sectors touched by brushes C and D, and these\\nback sectors will receive by induction positive and negative14\\ncharges respectively. This process continues as the plates\\nrotate, and finally all the sectors moving towards comb E\\nwill be positively charged, while those approaching comb\\nF will be negatively charged. The combs collect these\\ncharges, and the discharging rods K and L become highly\\nelectrified, K positively and L negatively, and if they are\\nnear enough together sparks will pass between them.',\n",
       " 'At the commencement we supposed one of the sectors\\nto have a positive charge, but it is not necessary to charge\\na sector specially, for the machine is self-starting. Why\\nthis is the case is not yet thoroughly understood, but probably\\nthe explanation is that at any particular moment no\\ntwo places in the atmosphere are in exactly the same15\\nelectro-static condition, so that an uneven state of charge\\nexists permanently amongst the sectors.',\n",
       " 'The Wimshurst machine provides us with a plentiful\\nsupply of electricity, and the question naturally arises,\\n“Can this electricity be stored up in any way?” In 1745,\\nlong before the days of influence machines, a certain Bishop\\nof Pomerania, Von Kleist by name, got the idea that if he\\ncould persuade a charge of electricity to go into a glass\\nbottle he would be able to capture it, because glass was a\\nnon-conductor. So he partly filled a bottle with water, led\\na wire down into the water, and while holding the bottle in\\none hand connected the wire to a primitive form of electric\\nmachine. When he thought he had got enough electricity\\nhe tried to remove his bottle in order to examine the contents,\\nand in so doing he received a shock which scared\\nhim considerably. He had succeeded in storing electricity\\nin his bottle. Shortly afterwards the bishop’s experiment\\nwas repeated by Professor Muschenbrock of Leyden, and\\nby his pupil Cuneus, the former being so startled by the\\nshock that he wrote, “I would not take a second shock for\\nthe kingdom of France.” But in spite of shocks the end\\nwas achieved; it was proved that electricity could be collected\\nand stored up, and the bottle became known as the\\nLeyden jar. The original idea was soon improved upon,\\nwater being replaced by a coating of tinfoil, and it was\\nfound that better results were obtained by coating the\\noutside of the bottle as well as the inside.',\n",
       " 'As now used the Leyden jar consists of a glass jar\\ncovered inside and outside with tinfoil up to about two-thirds\\nof its height. A wooden lid is fitted, through which passes\\na brass rod terminating above in a brass knob, and below\\nin a piece of brass chain long enough to touch the foil\\nlining. A Leyden jar is charged by holding it in one\\nhand with its knob presented to the discharging ball of a16\\nWimshurst machine, and even if the machine is small and\\nfeeble the jar will accumulate electricity until it is very\\nhighly charged. It may now be put down on the table,\\nand if it is clean and quite dry it will hold its charge for\\nsome time. If the outer and inner coatings of the jar are\\nconnected by means of a piece of metal, the electricity will\\nbe discharged in the form of a bright spark. A Leyden\\njar is usually discharged by means of discharging tongs,\\nconsisting of a jointed brass rod with brass terminal\\nknobs and glass handles. One knob is placed in contact\\nwith the outer coating of foil, and the other brought near\\nto the knob of the jar, which of course is connected with\\nthe inner coating.',\n",
       " 'The electrical capacity of even a small Leyden jar is\\nsurprisingly great, and this is due to the mutual attraction\\nbetween opposite kinds of electricity. If we stick a piece\\nof tinfoil on the centre of each face of a pane of glass, and\\ncharge one positively and the other negatively, the two\\ncharges attract each other through the glass; and in fact\\nthey hold on to each other so strongly that we can get very\\nlittle electricity by touching either piece of foil. This\\nmutual attraction enables us to charge the two pieces of\\nfoil much more strongly than if they were each on a\\nseparate pane, and this is the secret of the working of the\\nLeyden jar. If the knob of the jar is held to the positive\\nball of a Wimshurst, the inside coating receives a positive\\ncharge, which acts inductively on the outside coating,\\nattracting a negative charge to the inner face of the latter,\\nand repelling a positive charge to its outer face, and thence\\naway through the hand. The electricity is entirely confined\\nto the sides of the jar, the interior having no charge\\nwhatever.',\n",
       " 'Leyden jars are very often fitted to a Wimshurst\\nmachine as shown at A, A, Fig. 4, and arranged so that they17\\ncan be connected or disconnected to the collecting combs\\nas desired. When the jars are disconnected the machine\\ngives a rapid succession of thin sparks, but when the jars\\nare connected to the combs they accumulate a number of\\ncharges before the discharge takes place, with the result\\nthat the sparks are thicker, but occur at less frequent\\nintervals.',\n",
       " 'It will have been noticed that the rod of a Leyden jar\\nand the discharging rods of a Wimshurst machine are\\nmade to terminate not in points, but in rounded knobs or\\nballs. The reason of this is that electricity rapidly leaks\\naway from points. If we electrify a conductor shaped like\\na cone with a sharp point, the density of the electricity is\\ngreatest at that point, and when it becomes sufficiently\\ngreat the particles of air near the point become electrified\\nand repelled. Other particles take their place, and are\\nelectrified and repelled in the same way, and so a constant\\nloss of electricity takes place. This may be shown in an\\ninteresting way by fastening with wax a needle to the knob\\nof a Wimshurst. If a lighted taper is held to the point of\\nthe needle while the machine is in action, the flame is\\nblown aside by the streams of repelled air, which form a\\nsort of electric wind.',\n",
       " 'If the Leyden jars of a Wimshurst machine are connected\\nup and the discharging balls placed at a suitable distance\\napart, the electricity produced by rotating the plates is\\ndischarged in the form of a brilliant zigzag spark between\\nthe balls, accompanied by a sharp crack. The resemblance\\nbetween this spark and forked lightning is at once evident,\\nand in fact it is lightning in miniature. The discharging\\nballs are charged, as we have seen, with opposite kinds of\\nelectricity, and these charges are constantly trying to reach\\none another across the intervening air, which, being an\\ninsulator, vigorously opposes their passage. There is thus\\na kind of struggle going on between the air and the two\\ncharges of electricity, and this keeps the air in a state of\\nconstant strain. But the resisting power of the air is\\nlimited, and when the charges reach a certain strength the\\nelectricity violently forces its way across, literally rupturing\\nor splitting the air. The particles of air along the path of\\nthe discharge are rendered incandescent by the heat produced\\nby the passage of the electricity, and so the brilliant\\nflash is produced. Just as a river winds about seeking the\\neasiest course, so the electricity takes the path of least\\nresistance, which probably is determined by the particles\\nof dust in the air, and also by the density of the air, which\\nbecomes compressed in front, leaving less dense air and\\ntherefore an easier path on each side.',\n",

       " 'The connexion between lightning and the sparks from\\nelectrified bodies and electrical machines was suspected by\\nmany early observers, but it remained for Benjamin\\nFranklin to prove that lightning was simply a tremendous\\nelectric discharge, by actually obtaining electricity from a\\nthunder-cloud. Franklin was an American, born at Boston\\nin 1706. He was a remarkable man in every way, and\\nquite apart from his investigations in electricity, will always\\nbe remembered for the great public services he rendered to\\nhis country in general and to Philadelphia in particular.\\nHe founded the Philadelphia Library, the American Philosophical\\nSociety, and the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",
       " 'Franklin noticed many similarities between electricity\\nand lightning. For instance, both produced zigzag sparks,\\nboth were conducted by metals, both set fire to inflammable\\nmaterials, and both were capable of killing animals. These\\nresemblances appeared to him so striking that he was\\nconvinced that the two were the same, and he resolved to\\nput the matter to the test. For this purpose he hit upon\\nthe idea of using a kite, to the top of which was fixed a\\npointed wire. At the lower end of the flying string was\\ntied a key, insulated by a piece of silk ribbon. In June\\n1752, Franklin flew his kite, and after waiting a while he\\nwas rewarded by finding that when he brought his knuckle\\nnear to the key a little spark made its appearance. This\\nspark was exactly like the sparks obtained from electrified\\nbodies, but to make things quite certain a Leyden jar was\\ncharged from the key. Various experiments were then\\nperformed with the jar, and it was proved beyond all doubt\\nthat lightning and electricity were one and the same.',\n",
       " 'Lightning is then an enormous electric spark between a\\ncloud and the Earth, or between two clouds, produced when\\nopposite charges become so strong that they are able to\\nbreak down the intervening non-conducting layer of air.20\\nThe surface of the Earth is negatively electrified, the\\nelectrification varying at different times and places; while\\nthe electricity of the air is usually positive, but frequently\\nchanges to negative in rainy weather and on other occasions.\\nAs the clouds float about they collect the electricity from\\nthe air, and thus they may be either positively or negatively\\nelectrified, so that a discharge may take place between one\\ncloud and another, as well as between a cloud and the Earth.',\n",
       " 'Lightning flashes take different forms, the commonest\\nbeing forked or zigzag lightning, and sheet lightning.\\nThe zigzag form is due to the discharge taking the easiest\\npath, as in the case of the spark from a Wimshurst machine.\\nSheet lightning is probably the reflection of a flash taking\\nplace at a distance. It may be unaccompanied by thunder,\\nas in the so-called “summer lightning,” seen on the horizon\\nat night, which is the reflection of a storm too far off for the\\nthunder to be heard. A much rarer form is globular or\\nball lightning, in which the discharge takes the shape of a\\nball of light, which moves slowly along and finally disappears\\nwith a sudden explosion. The cause of this form\\nof lightning is not yet understood, but it is possible that the\\nball of light consists of intensely heated and extremely\\nminute fragments of ordinary matter, torn off by the\\nviolence of the lightning discharge. Another uncommon\\nform is multiple lightning, which consists of a number of\\nseparate parallel discharges having the appearance of a\\nribbon.',\n",
       " 'A lightning flash probably lasts from about 1/100,000 to\\n1/1,000,000 of a second, and in the majority of cases the\\ndischarge is oscillatory; that is to say, it passes several times\\nbackwards and forwards between two clouds or between a\\ncloud and the Earth.

This is not the case\\nhowever, for no pain is felt until the impression reaches the\\nbrain by way of the nerves, and this takes an appreciable\\ntime. The nerves transmit sensations at a speed of only\\nabout one hundred feet per second, so that in the case of a\\nman killed by a bullet through the brain, no pain would be\\nfelt, because the brain would be deprived of sensibility\\nbefore the sensation could reach it.

It\\nnever occurred to him that\\nthe source of the electricity\\nmight be found in something\\nquite apart from the legs,\\nand so he came to the conclusion\\nthat the phenomenon\\nwas due to electricity produced\\nin some mysterious\\nway in the tissues of the\\nanimal itself. He therefore\\nannounced that he had discovered\\nthe existence of a\\nkind of animal electricity,\\nand it was left for his fellow-countryman,\\nAlessandro\\nVolta, to prove that the\\ntwitchings were due to electricity\\nproduced by the contact\\nof the two metals, the iron of the window rail and the\\ncopper wire.',\n",
       " 'Volta found that when two different metals were placed in\\ncontact in air, one became positively charged, and the other\\nnegatively. These charges however were extremely feeble,\\nand in his endeavours to obtain stronger results he hit upon\\nthe idea of using a number of pairs of metals, and he constructed\\nthe apparatus known as the Voltaic pile, Fig. 6.29\\nThis consists of a number of pairs of zinc and copper\\ndiscs, each pair being separated from the next pair by a\\ndisc of cloth moistened with salt water. These are piled\\nup and placed in a frame, as shown in the figure. One\\nend of the pile thus terminates in a zinc disc, and the other\\nin a copper disc, and as soon as the two are connected by\\na wire or other conductor a continuous current of electricity\\nis produced. The cause of the electricity produced by the\\nvoltaic pile was the subject of\\na long and heated controversy.\\nThere were two main theories;\\nthat of Volta himself, which\\nattributed the electricity to the\\nmere contact of unlike metals,\\nand the chemical theory, which\\nascribed it to chemical action.\\nThe chemical theory is now\\ngenerally accepted, but certain\\npoints, into which we need not\\nenter, are still in dispute.',\n",
       " 'There is a curious experiment\\nwhich some of my readers\\nmay like to try. Place a copper\\ncoin on a sheet of zinc, and set an\\nordinary garden snail to crawl\\nacross the zinc towards the coin. As soon as the snail\\ncomes in contact with the copper it shrinks back, and shows\\nevery sign of having received a shock. One can well\\nimagine that an enthusiastic gardener pestered with snails\\nwould watch this experiment with great glee.',\n",
       " 'Volta soon found that it was not necessary to have his\\npairs of metals in actual metallic contact, and that better\\nresults were got by placing them in a vessel filled with\\ndilute acid. Fig. 7 is a diagram of a simple voltaic cell of30\\nthis kind, and it shows the direction of the current when\\nthe zinc and the copper are connected by the wire. In\\norder to get some idea of the reason why a current flows\\nwe must understand the meaning of electric potential. If\\nwater is poured into a vessel, a certain water pressure is\\nproduced. The amount of this pressure depends upon the\\nlevel of the water, and this in turn depends upon the\\nquantity of water and the capacity of the vessel, for a\\ngiven quantity of water will reach a higher level in a small\\nvessel than in a larger one. In the same way, if electricity\\nis imparted to a conductor an electric pressure is\\nproduced, its amount depending upon the quantity of\\nelectricity and the electric capacity of the conductor, for\\nconductors vary in capacity just as water vessels do.',\n",
       " 'This electric pressure is called “potential,” and electricity\\ntends to flow from a conductor of higher to one of lower\\npotential. When we say that a place is so many feet\\nabove or below sea-level we are using the level of the sea\\nas a zero level, and in estimating electric potential we take\\nthe potential of the earth’s surface as zero; and we regard\\na positively electrified body as one at a positive or relatively\\nhigh potential, and a negatively electrified body as\\none at a negative or relatively low potential. This may be\\nclearer if we think of temperature and the thermometer.\\nTemperatures above zero are positive and represented by\\nthe sign +, and those below zero are negative and represented\\nby the sign -. Thus we assume that an electric\\ncurrent flows from a positive to a negative conductor.',\n",
       " 'In a voltaic cell the plates are at different potentials, so\\nthat when they are connected by a wire a current flows,\\nand we say that the current leaves the cell at the positive\\nterminal, and enters it again at the negative terminal. As\\nshown in Fig. 7, the current moves in opposite directions\\ninside and outside the cell, making a complete round called\\na circuit, and if the circuit is broken anywhere the current\\nceases to flow. If the circuit is complete the current keeps\\non flowing, trying to equalize the electric pressure or\\npotential, but it is unable to do this because the chemical\\naction between the acid and the zinc maintains the difference\\nof potential between the plates. This chemical action\\nresults in wasting of the zinc and weakening of the acid,\\nand as long as it continues the current keeps on flowing.\\nWhen we wish to stop the current we break the circuit by\\ndisconnecting the wire joining the terminals, and the cell\\nthen should be at rest; but owing to the impurities in\\nordinary commercial zinc chemical action still continues.\\nIn order to prevent wasting when the current is not required\\nthe surface of the zinc is coated with a thin film of\\nmercury. The zinc is then said to be amalgamated, and\\nit is not acted upon by the acid so long as the circuit\\nremains broken.',\n",
       " 'The current from a simple voltaic cell does not remain\\nat a constant strength, but after a short time it begins to\\nweaken rapidly. The cell is then said to be polarized, and\\nthis polarization is caused by bubbles of hydrogen gas\\nwhich accumulate on the surface of the copper plate during\\nthe chemical action. These bubbles of gas weaken the\\ncurrent partly by resisting its flow, for they are bad conductors,\\nand still more by trying to set up another current\\nin the opposite direction. For this reason the simple\\nvoltaic cell is unsuitable for long spells of work, and many\\ncells have been devised to avoid the polarization trouble.\\nOne of the most successful of these is the Daniell cell. It\\nconsists of an outer vessel of copper, which serves as the\\ncopper plate, and an inner porous pot containing a zinc\\nrod. Dilute sulphuric acid is put into the porous pot and\\na strong solution of copper sulphate into the outer jar.\\nWhen the circuit is closed, the hydrogen liberated by the32\\naction of the zinc on the acid passes through the porous\\npot, and splits up the copper sulphate into copper and\\nsulphuric acid. In this way pure copper, instead of\\nhydrogen, is deposited on the copper plate, no polarization\\ntakes place, and the current is constant.',\n",
       " 'Other cells have different combinations of metals, such\\nas silver-zinc, or platinum-zinc, and carbon is also largely\\nused in place of one metal, as in the familiar carbon-zinc\\nLeclanché cell, used for ringing electric bells. This cell\\nconsists of an inner porous pot containing a carbon plate\\npacked round with a mixture of crushed carbon and manganese\\ndioxide, and an outer glass jar containing a zinc\\nrod and a solution of sal-ammoniac. Polarization is\\nchecked by the oxygen in the manganese dioxide, which\\nseizes the hydrogen on its way to the carbon plate, and\\ncombines with it. If the cell is used continuously however\\nthis action cannot keep pace with the rate at which the\\nhydrogen is produced, and so the cell becomes polarized;\\nbut it soon recovers after a short rest.',\n",
       " 'The so-called “dry” cells so much used at the present\\ntime are not really dry at all; if they were they would give\\nno current. They are in fact Leclanché cells, in which\\nthe containing vessel is made of zinc to take the place of a\\nzinc rod; and they are dry only in the sense that the liquid\\nis taken up by an absorbent material, so as to form a moist\\npaste. Dry cells are placed inside closely fitting cardboard\\ntubes, and are sealed up at the top. Their chief advantage\\nlies in their portability, for as there is no free liquid to\\nspill they can be carried about and placed in any position.',\n",
       " 'We have seen that the continuance of the current from\\na voltaic cell depends upon the keeping up of a difference\\nof potential between the plates. The force which serves\\nto maintain this difference is called the electro-motive force,\\nand it is measured in volts. The actual flow of electricity33\\nis measured in amperes. Probably all my readers are\\nfamiliar with the terms volt and ampere, but perhaps some\\nmay not be quite clear about the distinction between the\\ntwo. When water flows along a pipe we know that it is\\nbeing forced to do so by pressure resulting from a difference\\nof level. That is to say, a difference of level produces\\na water-moving or water-motive force; and in a\\nsimilar way a difference of potential produces an electricity-moving\\nor electro-motive force, which is measured\\nin volts. If we wish to describe the rate of flow of water\\nwe state it in gallons per second, and the rate of flow of\\nelectricity is stated in amperes. Volts thus represent the\\npressure at which a current is supplied, while the current\\nitself is measured in amperes.',\n",
       " 'We may take this opportunity of speaking of electric\\nresistance. A current of water flowing through a pipe is\\nresisted by friction against the inner surface of the pipe;\\nand a current of electricity flowing through a circuit also\\nmeets with a resistance, though this is not due to friction.\\nIn a good conductor this resistance is small, but in a bad\\nconductor or non-conductor it is very great. The resistance\\nalso depends upon length and area of cross-section; so that\\na long wire offers more resistance than a short one, and a\\nthin wire more than a thick one. Before any current can\\nflow in a circuit the electro-motive force must overcome\\nthe resistance, and we might say that the volts drive the\\namperes through the resistance. The unit of resistance is\\nthe ohm, and the definition of a volt is that electro-motive\\nforce which will cause a current of one ampere to flow\\nthrough a conductor having a resistance of one ohm. These\\nunits of measurement are named after three famous scientists,\\nVolta, Ampère, and Ohm.',\n",
       " 'A number of cells coupled together form a battery, and\\ndifferent methods of coupling are used to get different34\\nresults. In addition to the resistance of the circuit outside\\nthe cell, the cell itself offers an internal resistance, and part\\nof the electro-motive force is used up in overcoming this\\nresistance. If we can decrease this internal resistance we\\nshall have a larger current at our disposal, and one way of\\ndoing this is to increase the size of the plates. This of\\ncourse means making the cell larger, and very large cells\\ntake up a lot of room and are troublesome to move about.\\nWe can get the same effect however by coupling. If we\\nconnect together all the positive terminals and all the\\nnegative terminals of several cells, that is, copper to copper\\nand zinc to zinc in Daniell cells, we get the same result as\\nif we had one very large cell. The current is much larger,\\nbut the electro-motive force remains the same as if only\\none cell were used, or in other words we have more amperes\\nbut no more volts. This is called connecting in “parallel,”\\nand the method is shown in Fig. 8. On the other hand,\\nif, as is usually the case, we want a larger electro-motive\\nforce, we connect the positive terminal of one cell to the\\nnegative terminal of the next, or copper to zinc all through.\\nIn this way we add together the electro-motive forces of all\\nthe cells, but the amount of current remains that of a single\\ncell; that is, we get more volts but no more amperes. This is\\ncalled connecting in “series,” and the arrangement is shown35\\nin Fig. 9. We can also increase both volts and amperes by\\ncombining the two methods.',\n",
       " 'A voltaic cell gives us a considerable quantity of\\nelectricity at low pressure, the electro-motive force of a\\nLeclanché cell being about 1½ volts, and that of a Daniell\\ncell about 1 volt. We may perhaps get some idea of the\\nelectrical conditions existing during a thunderstorm from\\nthe fact that to produce a spark one mile long through air\\nat ordinary pressure we should require a battery of more\\nthan a thousand million Daniell cells. Cells such as we\\nhave described in this chapter are called primary cells, as\\ndistinguished from accumulators, which are called secondary\\ncells. Some of the practical applications of primary cells\\nwill be described in later chapters.',\n",
       " 'Besides the voltaic cell, in which the current is produced\\nby chemical action, there is the thermo-electric battery, or\\nthermopile, which produces current directly from heat\\nenergy. About 1822 Seebeck was experimenting with\\nvoltaic pairs of metals, and he found that a current could\\nbe produced in a complete metallic circuit consisting of\\ndifferent metals joined together, by keeping these joinings\\nat different temperatures. Fig. 10 shows a simple arrangement\\nfor demonstrating this effect, which is known as the36\\n“Seebeck effect.” A slab of bismuth, BB, has placed upon it\\na bent strip of copper, C. If one of the junctions of the\\ntwo metals is heated as shown, a current flows; and the\\nsame effect is produced\\nby cooling one of the\\njunctions. This current\\ncontinues to flow\\nas long as the two junctions\\nare kept at different\\ntemperatures. In\\n1834 another scientist,\\nPeltier, discovered that\\nif a current was passed\\nacross a junction of two different metals, this junction was\\neither heated or cooled, according to the direction in which\\nthe current flowed. In Fig. 10 the current across the\\nheated junction tends to cool the junction, while the Bunsen\\nburner opposes this cooling, and keeps up the temperature.\\nA certain amount of the heat energy is thus transformed\\ninto electrical\\nenergy. At the\\nother junction\\nthe current\\nproduces a\\nheating effect,\\nso that some of\\nthe electrical\\nenergy is retransformed\\ninto heat.',\n",
       " 'A thermopile consists of a number of alternate bars or\\nstrips of two unlike metals, joined together as shown\\ndiagrammatically in Fig. 11. The arrangement is such\\nthat the odd junctions are at one side, and the even ones37\\nat the other. The odd junctions are heated, and the even\\nones cooled, and a current flows when the circuit is completed.\\nBy using a larger number of junctions, and by\\nincreasing the difference of temperature between them, the\\nvoltage of the current may be increased. Thermopiles are\\nnothing like so efficient as voltaic cells, and they are more\\ncostly. They are used to a limited extent for purposes\\nrequiring a very small and constant current, but for\\ngenerating considerable quantities of current at high\\npressure they are quite useless. The only really important\\npractical use of the thermopile is in the detection and\\nmeasurement of very minute differences of temperature,\\nwhich are beyond the capabilities of the ordinary thermometer.\\nWithin certain limits, the electro-motive force of a\\nthermopile is exactly proportionate to the difference of\\ntemperature. The very slightest difference of temperature\\nproduces a current, and by connecting the wires from a\\nspecially constructed thermopile to a delicate instrument\\nfor measuring the strength of the current, temperature\\ndifferences of less than one-millionth of a degree can be\\ndetected.',\n",
       " 'If we had two large water tanks, one of which could be\\nemptied only by allowing the bottom to fall completely out,\\nand the other by means of a narrow pipe, it is easy to see\\nwhich would be the more useful to us as a source of water\\nsupply. If both tanks were filled, then from the first we\\ncould get only a sudden uncontrollable rush of water, but\\nfrom the other we could get a steady stream extending over\\na long period, and easily controlled. The Leyden jar stores\\nelectricity, but in yielding up its store it acts like the first\\ntank, giving a sudden discharge in the form of a bright\\nspark. We cannot control the discharge, and therefore we\\ncannot make it do useful work for us. For practical\\npurposes we require a storing arrangement that will act like\\nthe second tank, giving us a steady current of electricity\\nfor a long period, and this we have in the accumulator or\\nstorage cell.',\n",
       " 'A current of electricity has the power of decomposing\\ncertain liquids. If we pass a current through water, the\\nwater is split up into its two constituent gases, hydrogen\\nand oxygen, and this may be shown by the apparatus seen\\nin Fig. 12. It consists of a glass vessel with two strips of\\nplatinum to which the current is led. The vessel contains\\nwater to which has been added a little sulphuric acid to\\nincrease its conducting power, and over the strips are inverted\\ntwo test-tubes filled with the acidulated water. The39\\nplatinum strips, which are called electrodes, are connected\\nto a battery of Daniell cells. When the current passes,\\nthe water is decomposed, and oxygen collects at the electrode\\nconnected to the positive terminal of the battery, and\\nhydrogen at the other electrode. The two gases rise up\\ninto the test-tubes and displace the water in them, and the\\nwhole process is called the electrolysis of water. If now\\nwe disconnect the battery and join the two electrodes by\\na wire, we find that a current flows from the apparatus\\nas from a voltaic cell, but\\nin the opposite direction\\nfrom the original battery\\ncurrent.',\n",
       " 'It will be remembered\\nthat one of the troubles\\nwith a simple voltaic cell\\nwas polarization, caused\\nby the accumulation of\\nhydrogen; and that this\\nweakened the current by\\nsetting up an opposing\\nelectro-motive force tending\\nto produce another\\ncurrent in the opposite\\ndirection. In the present\\ncase a similar opposing or back electro-motive force is\\nproduced, and as soon as the battery current is stopped\\nand the electrodes are connected, we get a current in the\\nreverse direction, and this current continues to flow until\\nthe two gases have recombined, and the electrodes have\\nregained their original condition. Consequently we can\\nsee that in order to electrolyze water, our battery must\\nhave an electro-motive force greater than that set up in\\nopposition to it, and at least two Daniell cells are required.',\n",

This is a rough-and-ready way of putting the\\nmatter, but it is good enough for practical purposes, and at\\nany rate it makes it quite clear that what an accumulator\\nreally stores up is not electricity, but energy, which is given\\nout in the form of electricity.',\n",
       " 'The apparatus just described is of little use as a source\\nof current, and the first really practical accumulator was\\nmade in 1878 by Gaston Planté. The electrodes were two\\nstrips of sheet lead placed one upon the other, but separated\\nby some insulating material, and made into a roll. This\\nroll was placed in dilute sulphuric acid, and one strip or\\nplate connected to the positive, and the other to the\\nnegative terminal of the source of current. The current\\nwas passed for a certain length of time, and then the accumulator\\npartly discharged; after which current was passed\\nagain, but in the reverse direction, followed by another period\\nof discharge. This process, which is called forming,\\nwas continued for several days, and its effect was to change\\none plate into a spongy condition, and to form a coating\\nof peroxide of lead on the other. When the plates were\\nproperly formed the accumulator was ready to be fully\\ncharged and put into use. The effect of charging was to\\nrob one plate of its oxygen, and to transfer this oxygen to\\nthe other plate, which thus received an overcharge of the\\ngas. During the discharge of the accumulator the excess\\nof oxygen went back to the place from which it had been\\ntaken, and the current continued until the surfaces of both41\\nplates were reduced to a chemically inactive state. The\\naccumulator could be charged and discharged over and\\nover again as long as the plates remained in good order.',\n",
       " 'In 1881, Faure hit upon the idea of coating the plates\\nwith a paste of red-lead, and this greatly shortened the\\ntime of forming. At first it was found difficult to make the\\npaste stick to the plates, but this trouble was got rid of by\\nmaking the plates in the form of grids, and pressing the\\npaste into the perforations. Many further improvements\\nhave been made from time to time, but instead of tracing\\nthese we will go on at once to the description of a present-day\\naccumulator. There are now many excellent accumulators\\nmade, but we have not space to consider more than\\none, and we will select that known as the “Chloride”\\naccumulator.',\n",
       " 'The positive plate of this accumulator is of the Planté\\ntype, but it is not simply a casting of pure lead, but is made\\nby a building-up process which allows of the use of a\\nlead-antimony mixture for the grids. This gives greater\\nstrength, and the grids themselves are unaffected by the\\nchemical changes which take place during the charging and\\ndischarging of the cell. The active material, that is the\\nmaterial which undergoes chemical change, is pure lead\\ntape coiled up into rosettes, which are so designed that the\\nacid can circulate through the plates. These rosettes are\\ndriven into the perforations of the grid by a hydraulic press,\\nand during the process of forming they expand and thus\\nbecome very firmly fixed. The negative plate has a frame\\nmade in two parts, which are riveted together after the\\ninsertion of the active material, which is thus contained in\\na number of small cages. The plate is covered outside\\nwith a finely perforated sheet of lead, which prevents the\\nactive material from falling out. It is of the utmost\\nimportance that the positive and negative plates should be42\\nkept apart when in the cell, and in the Chloride accumulator\\nthis is ensured by the use of a patent separator made of\\na thin sheet of wood the size of the plates. Before being\\nused the wood undergoes a special treatment to remove all\\nsubstances which might be harmful, and it then remains\\nunchanged either in appearance or composition. Other\\ninsulating substances, such as glass rods or ebonite forks,\\ncan be used as separators, but it is claimed that the wood\\nseparator is not only more satisfactory, but that in some\\nunexplained way it actually helps to keep up the capacity\\nof the cell. The plates are placed in glass, or lead-lined\\nwood or metal boxes, and are suspended from above the\\ndilute sulphuric acid with which the cells are filled. A\\nspace is left below the plates for the sediment which\\naccumulates during the working of the cell.',\n",
       " 'In all but the smallest cells several pairs of plates are\\nused, all the positive plates being connected together and\\nall the negative plates. This gives the same effect as two\\nvery large plates, on the principle of connecting in parallel,\\nspoken of in Chapter IV. A single cell, of whatever size,\\ngives current at about two volts, and to get higher voltages\\nmany cells are connected in series, as with primary cells.\\nThe capacity is generally measured in ampere-hours. For\\ninstance, an accumulator that will give a current of eight\\namperes for one hour, or of four amperes for two hours, or\\none ampere for eight hours, is said to have a capacity of\\neight ampere-hours.',\n",
       " 'Accumulators are usually charged from a dynamo or\\nfrom the public mains, and the electro-motive force of\\nthe charging current must be not less than 2½ volts for\\neach cell, in order to overcome the back electro-motive\\nforce of the cells themselves.

       " 'If we place the north pole of a bar magnet near to, but\\nnot touching, a bar of soft iron, as in Plate II.a, we find that\\nthe latter becomes a magnet, as shown by its ability to\\nsupport filings; and that as soon as the magnet is removed\\nthe filings drop off, showing that the iron has lost its\\nmagnetism. If the iron is tested while the magnet is in\\nposition it is found to have a south pole at the end nearer\\nthe magnet, and a north pole at the end farther away; and\\nif the magnet is reversed, so as to bring its south pole\\nnearer the iron, the poles of the latter are found to reverse\\nalso. The iron has gained its new properties by magnetic\\ninduction, and we cannot fail to notice the similarity between\\nthis experiment and that in Fig. 2, Chapter II., which\\nshowed electro-static induction. A positively or a negatively\\nelectrified body induces an opposite charge at the\\nnearer end, and a similar charge at the further end of a\\nconductor, and a north or a south pole of a magnet\\ninduces opposite polarity at the nearer end, and a\\nsimilar polarity at the further end of a bar of iron. In\\nChapter II. we showed that the attraction of a pith ball\\nby an electrified body was due to induction, and from what\\nwe have just learnt about magnetic induction the reader\\nwill have no difficulty in understanding why a magnet\\nattracts filings or needles.',\n",
       " 'Any one who experiments with magnets must be struck\\nwith the distance at which one magnet can influence filings\\nor another magnet. If a layer of iron filings is spread on a\\nsheet of paper, and a magnet brought gradually nearer\\nfrom above, the filings soon begin to move about restlessly,\\nand when the magnet comes close enough they fly up to it\\nas if pulled by invisible strings. A still more striking49\\nexperiment consists in spreading filings thinly over a sheet\\nof cardboard and moving a magnet to and fro underneath\\nthe sheet. The result is most amusing. The filings seem\\nto stand up on their hind legs, and they march about like\\nregiments of soldiers. Here again invisible strings are\\nsuggested, and we might wonder whether there really is\\nanything of the kind. Yes, there is. To put the matter\\nin the simplest way, the magnet acts by means of strings\\nor lines of force, which emerge from it in definite directions,\\nand in a most interesting way we can see some of these\\nlines of force actually at work.',\n",
       " 'Place a magnet, or any arrangement of magnets, underneath\\na sheet of glass, and sprinkle iron filings from a\\nmuslin bag thinly and evenly all over the glass. Then tap\\nthe glass gently with a pencil, and the filings at once\\narrange themselves in a most remarkable manner. All the\\nfilings become magnetized by induction, and when the tap\\nsets them free for an instant from the friction of the glass\\nthey take up definite positions under the influence of the\\nforce acting upon them. In this way we get a map of\\nthe general direction of the magnetic lines of force, which\\nare our invisible strings.',\n",

It\\ncan be shown, although in a much less simple manner, that50\\nlines of electric force proceed from electrified bodies, and\\nin electric attraction and repulsion between two charged\\nbodies the lines of force take paths which closely resemble\\nthose in our two figures. A space filled with lines of\\nmagnetic force is called a magnetic field, and one filled\\nwith lines of electric force is called an electric field.',\n",
       " 'A horse-shoe magnet, which is simply a bar of steel\\nbent into the shape of a horse-shoe before being magnetized,\\ngradually loses its magnetism if left with its poles\\nunprotected, but this loss is prevented if the poles are\\nconnected by a piece of soft iron. The same loss occurs\\nwith a bar magnet, but as the two poles cannot be connected\\nin this way it is customary to keep two bar magnets side\\nby side, separated by a strip of wood; with opposite poles\\ntogether and a piece of soft iron across the ends. Such\\npieces of iron are called keepers, and Fig. 13 shows a\\nhorse-shoe magnet and a pair of bar magnets with their\\nkeepers. It may be remarked that a magnet never should\\nbe knocked or allowed to fall, as rough usage of this kind\\ncauses it to lose a considerable amount of its magnetism.\\nA magnet is injured also by allowing the keeper to slam on\\nto it; but pulling the keeper off vigorously does good\\ninstead of harm.',\n",
       " 'If a magnetized needle is suspended so that it is free to\\nswing either horizontally or vertically, it not only comes\\nto rest in a north and south direction, but also it tilts with\\nits north-pointing end downwards.

In both\\ncases the angle the needle makes with the horizontal is\\ncalled the magnetic dip.',\n",
       " 'It is evident that a suspended magnetized needle would\\nnot invariably come to rest pointing north and south unless\\nit were compelled to do so, and a little consideration shows51\\nthat the needle acts as if it were under the influence of a\\nmagnet. Dr. Gilbert of Colchester, of whom we spoke in\\nChapter I., gave a great deal of time to the study of\\nmagnetic phenomena, and in 1600 he announced what may\\nbe regarded as his greatest discovery: The terrestrial\\nglobe itself is a great magnet. Here, then, is the explanation\\nof the behaviour of the magnetized needle. The Earth\\nitself is a great magnet, having its poles near to the\\ngeographical north and south poles. But a question at\\nonce suggests itself: “Since similar poles repel one another,\\nhow is it that the north pole of a magnet turns towards the\\nnorth magnetic pole of the earth?” This apparent difficulty\\nis caused by a confusion in terms. If the Earth’s\\nnorth magnetic pole really has north magnetism, then the\\nnorth-pointing end of a magnet must be a south pole; and\\non the other hand, if the north-pointing end of a magnet\\nhas north magnetism, then the Earth’s north magnetic pole\\nmust be really a south pole. It is a troublesome matter to\\nsettle, but it is now customary to regard the Earth’s north\\nmagnetic pole as possessing south magnetism, and the\\nsouth magnetic pole as possessing north magnetism. In\\nthis way the north-pointing pole of a magnet may be looked\\nupon as a true north pole, and the south-pointing pole as a\\ntrue south pole.',\n",
       " 'Magnetic dip also is seen to be a natural result of the\\nEarth’s magnetic influence. Here in England, for instance,\\nthe north magnetic pole is much nearer than the south\\nmagnetic pole, and consequently its influence is the\\nstronger. Therefore a magnetized needle, if free to do\\nso, dips downwards towards the north. At any place\\nwhere the south magnetic pole is the nearer the direction\\nof the dip of course is reversed. If placed immediately\\nover either magnetic pole the needle would take up a\\nvertical position, and at the magnetic equator it would not52\\ndip at all, for the influence of the two magnetic poles would\\nbe equal. A little study of Fig. 14, which represents a\\ndipping needle at different parts of the earth, will make\\nthis matter clearer. N and S represent the Earth’s north\\nand south magnetic poles, and the arrow heads are the\\nnorth poles of the needles.',\n",

A compound\\nneedle of this kind is very much more reliable than a\\nsingle needle. The material of which the card is made\\ndepends upon whether the illumination for night work is\\nto come from above or below. If the latter, the card must\\nbe transparent, and it is often made of thin sheet mica;\\nbut if the light comes from above, the card is made of\\nsome opaque material, such as very stout paper. The\\nneedle and card are contained in a sort of bowl made of\\ncopper. In order to keep this bowl in a horizontal position,\\nhowever the ship may be pitching and rolling, it is supported\\non gimbals, which are two concentric rings attached\\nto horizontal pivots, and moving in axes at right angles\\nto one another. Further stability may be obtained by\\nweighting the bottom of the bowl with lead. There are\\nalso liquid compasses, in which the card is floated on the\\nsurface of dilute alcohol, and many modern ships’ compasses\\nhave their movements regulated by a gyrostat.',\n",

In the\\nyear 1819 Professor Oersted, of the University of Copenhagen,\\ndiscovered that a freely swinging magnetized needle,\\nsuch as a compass needle, was deflected by a current of\\nelectricity flowing through a wire. In Fig. 15, A, a\\nmagnetic needle is shown at rest in its usual north and\\nsouth direction, and over it is held a copper wire, also\\npointing north and south. A current of electricity is now\\nsent through the wire, and the needle is at once deflected,\\nFig. 15, B. The direction of the current is indicated by57\\nan arrow, and the direction in which the needle has moved\\nis shown by the two small arrows. If the direction of the\\ncurrent is reversed, the needle will be deflected in the\\nopposite direction. From this experiment we see that the\\ncurrent has brought magnetic influences into play, or in\\nother words has produced magnetism. If iron filings are\\nbrought near the wire while the current is flowing, they\\nare at once attracted and cling to the wire, but as soon as\\nthe current is stopped\\nthey drop off. This\\nshows us that the wire\\nitself becomes a magnet\\nduring the passage of\\nthe current, and that it\\nloses its magnetism\\nwhen the current ceases\\nto flow.',\n",

Fig. 16\\nshows the direction of the lines of force of a wire conveying\\na current and passed through a horizontal piece of cardboard\\ncovered with a thin layer of iron filings; and from this\\nfigure it is evident that the passage of the current produces\\nwhat we may call magnetic whirls round the wire.',\n",

In large engineering\\nworks powerful electro-magnets, suspended from some\\nsort of travelling crane, are most useful for picking up and\\ncarrying about heavy masses of metal, such as large59\\ncastings. No time is lost in attaching the casting to the\\ncrane; the magnet picks it up directly the current is\\nswitched on, and lets it go the instant the current is\\nstopped.

This is called a galvanometer,\\nand in its simplest form it consists essentially of\\na delicately poised magnetic needle placed in the middle of\\na coil of several turns of wire. The current thus passes\\nmany times round the needle, and this has the effect of\\ngreatly increasing the deflection of the needle, and hence\\nthe sensitiveness of the instrument.

This may be shown in a simple way by\\nconnecting the ends of a coil of insulated wire to a galvanometer,67\\nand moving a bar magnet in and out of the coil;\\nwhen the galvanometer shows that a current is induced in\\nthe coil on the insertion of the magnet, and again on its\\nwithdrawal. We have seen that a magnet is surrounded\\nby a field of magnetic force, and Faraday found that the\\ncurrent was induced when the lines of force were cut across.',\n",
       " 'Utilizing this discovery Faraday constructed the first\\ndynamo, which consisted of a copper plate or disc rotated\\nbetween the poles of a powerful horse-shoe magnet, so as\\nto cut the lines of force. The current flowed either from\\nthe shaft to the rim, or vice versa, according to the direction\\nof rotation; and it was conducted away by means of two\\nwires with spring contacts, one pressing against the shaft,\\nand the other against the circumference of the disc. This\\nmachine was miserably inefficient, but it was the very first\\ndynamo, and from it have been slowly evolved the mighty\\ndynamos used to-day in electric power stations throughout\\nthe world. There is a little story told of Faraday\\nwhich is worth repeating even if it is not true. Speaking\\nof his discovery that a magnet could be made to produce\\nan electric current, a lady once said to him, “This is all\\nvery interesting, but what is the use of it?” “Madam,”\\nreplied Faraday, “what is the use of a baby?” In\\nFaraday’s “baby” dynamo, as in all others, some kind of\\npower must be used to produce the necessary motion, so\\nthat all dynamos are really machines for converting\\nmechanical energy into electrical energy.',\n",
       " 'The copper disc in this first dynamo did not prove\\nsatisfactory, and Faraday soon substituted for it rotating\\ncoils of wire. In 1832 a dynamo was constructed in which\\na length of insulated wire was wound upon two bobbins\\nhaving soft iron cores, and a powerful horse-shoe magnet\\nwas fixed to a rotating spindle in such a position that its\\npoles faced the cores of the bobbins. This machine gave68\\na fair current, but it was found that the magnet gradually\\nlost its magnetism on account of the vibration caused by\\nits rotation. The next step was to make the magnet a\\nfixture, and to rotate the bobbins of wire. This was a\\ngreat improvement, and the power of machines built on\\nthis principle was much increased by having a number of\\nrotating coils and several magnets. One such machine\\nhad 64 separate\\ncoils rotating\\nbetween the\\npoles of 40 large\\nmagnets.

From these brushes the current is69\\nled away into the main circuit, and in this case we may\\nsuppose that the current is used to light a lamp.',\n",
       " 'In speaking of the induction coil we saw that the\\ncurrents induced on making and on breaking the circuit\\nflowed in opposite directions, and similarly, Faraday found\\nthat the currents induced in a coil of wire on inserting and\\non withdrawing his magnet flowed in opposite directions.\\nIn the present case the magnet is stationary and the coil\\nmoves, but the effect is just the same. Now if we suppose\\nthe armature to be revolving in a clockwise direction, then\\nA¹ is descending and entering the magnetic field in front of\\nthe north pole, consequently a current is induced in the\\ncoil, and of course in the main circuit also, in one direction.\\nContinuing its course, A¹ passes away from this portion of\\nthe magnetic field, and thus a current is induced in the\\nopposite direction. In this way we get a current which\\nreverses its direction every half-revolution, and such a\\ncurrent is called an alternating current. If, as in our\\ndiagram, there are only two magnetic poles, the current\\nflows backwards and forwards once every revolution, but\\nby using a number of magnets, arranged so that the coil\\npasses in turn the poles of each, it can be made to flow\\nbackwards and forwards several times. One complete\\nflow backwards and forwards is called a period, and the\\nnumber of periods per second is called the periodicity or\\nfrequency of the current. A dynamo with one coil or set\\nof coils gives what is called “single-phase” current, that is, a\\ncurrent having one wave which keeps flowing backwards\\nand forwards. If there are two distinct sets of coils we get\\na two-phase current, in which there are two separate waves,\\none rising as the other falls. Similarly, by using more\\nsets of coils, we may obtain three-phase or polyphase\\ncurrents.',\n",
       " 'Alternating current is unsuitable for certain purposes,70\\nsuch as electroplating; and by making a small alteration in\\nour dynamo we get a continuous or direct current, which\\ndoes not reverse its direction. Fig. 20 shows the new\\narrangement. Instead of the two rings in Fig. 19, we have\\nnow a single ring divided into two parts, each half being\\nconnected to one end of the revolving coil. Each brush,\\ntherefore, remains on one portion of the ring for half a\\nrevolution, and\\nthen passes\\nover on to the\\nother portion.\\nDuring one\\nhalf-revolution\\nwe will suppose\\nthe current to\\nbe flowing from\\nbrush B¹ in the\\ndirection of the\\nlamp. Then\\nduring the next\\nhalf-revolution\\nthe current\\nflows in the opposite\\ndirection;\\nbut brush B¹\\nhas passed on\\nto the other half\\nof the ring, and so the current is still leaving by it.\\nIn this way the current must always flow in the same\\ndirection in the main circuit, leaving by brush B¹ and\\nreturning by brush B². This arrangement for making the\\nalternating current into a continuous current is called a\\ncommutator.',\n",
       " 'In actual practice a dynamo has a set of electro-magnets,\\nand the armature consists of many coils of wire mounted\\non a core of iron, which has the effect of concentrating the\\nlines of force. The armature generally revolves in small\\ndynamos, but in large ones it is usually a fixture, while the\\nelectro-magnets revolve. Plate IV. shows a typical dynamo\\nand its parts.',\n",
       " 'As we saw in an earlier chapter, an electro-magnet has\\nmagnetic powers only while a current is being passed\\nthrough its winding, and so some means of supplying\\ncurrent to the electro-magnets in a dynamo must be provided.\\nIt is a remarkable fact that it is almost impossible\\nto obtain a piece of iron which has not some traces of\\nmagnetism, and so when a dynamo is first set up there is\\noften sufficient magnetism in the iron of the electro-magnets\\nto produce a very weak field. The rapid cutting of the\\nfeeble lines of force of this field sets up a weak current,\\nwhich, acting upon the electro-magnets, gradually brings\\nthem up to full strength. Once the dynamo is generating\\ncurrent it keeps on feeding its magnets by sending either\\nthe whole or a part of its current through them. After\\nit has once been set going the dynamo is always able to\\nstart again, because the magnet cores retain enough\\nmagnetism to set up a weak field. If there is not enough\\nmagnetism in the cores to start a dynamo for the first\\ntime, a current from some outside source is sent round the\\nmagnets.',\n",
       " 'The foregoing remarks apply to continuous current\\ndynamos only. Alternating current can be used for exciting\\nelectro-magnets, but in this case the magnetic field produced\\nis alternating also, so that each pole of the magnet has\\nnorth and south magnetism alternately. This will not do\\nfor dynamo field magnets, and therefore an alternating\\ncurrent dynamo cannot feed its own magnets. The electro-magnets\\nin such dynamos are supplied with current from a72\\nseparate continuous current dynamo, which may be of quite\\nsmall size.',\n",
       " 'It is a very interesting fact that electric current can\\nbe generated by a dynamo in which the earth itself is\\nused to provide the magnetic field, no permanent or electro-magnets\\nbeing used at all. A simple form of dynamo\\nof this kind consists of a rectangular loop of copper wire\\nrotating about an axis pointing east and west, so that\\nthe loop cuts the lines of force of the Earth’s magnetic\\nfield.',\n",
       " 'The dynamo provides us with a constant supply of\\nelectric current, but this current is no use unless we can\\nmake it do work for us. If we reverse the usual order of\\nthings in regard to a dynamo, and supply the machine with\\ncurrent instead of mechanical power, we find that the\\narmature begins to revolve rapidly, and the machine is\\nno longer a dynamo, but has become an electric motor.\\nThis shows us that an electric motor is simply a dynamo\\nreversed. Let us suppose that we wish to use the\\ndynamo in Fig. 20 as a motor. In order to supply the\\ncurrent we will take away the lamp and substitute a\\nsecond continuous-current dynamo. We know from\\nChapter VII. that when a current is sent through a coil\\nof wire the coil becomes a magnet with a north and a\\nsouth pole. The coil in our dynamo becomes a magnet\\nas soon as the current is switched on, and the attraction\\nbetween its poles and the opposite poles of the magnet\\ncauses it to make half a revolution. At this point the\\ncommutator reverses the current, and consequently the\\npolarity of the coil, so that there is now repulsion where\\npreviously there was attraction, and the coil makes another\\nhalf-revolution. So the process goes on until the armature\\nattains a very high speed. In general construction there is\\npractically no difference between a dynamo and a motor,73\\nbut there are differences in detail which adapt each to its\\nown particular work. By making certain alterations in\\ntheir construction electric motors can be run with alternating\\ncurrent.',\n",
       " 'The fact that a dynamo could be reversed and run as a\\nmotor was known probably as early as 1838, but the great\\nvalue of this reversibility does not seem to have been\\nrealized until 1873. At an industrial exhibition held at\\nVienna in that year, it so happened that a workman or\\nmachinery attendant connected two cables to a dynamo\\nwhich was standing idle, and he was much surprised to\\nfind that it at once began to revolve at a great speed. It\\nwas then seen that the cables led to another dynamo which\\nwas running, and that the current from this source had\\nmade the first dynamo into a motor. There are many\\nversions of this story, but the important point in all\\nis that this was the first occasion on which general\\nattention was drawn to the possibilities of the electric\\nmotor.',\n",
       " 'The practical advantages afforded by the electric motor\\nare many and great. Once we have installed a sufficiently\\npowerful dynamo and a steam or other engine to drive it,\\nwe can place motors just where they are required, either\\nclose to the dynamo or miles away, driving them simply by\\nmeans of a connecting cable. In factories, motors can be\\nplaced close to the machines they are required to drive,\\nanywhere in the building, thus doing away with all complicated\\nand dangerous systems of shafting and belts. In\\nmany cases where it would be either utterly impossible or\\nat least extremely inconvenient to use any form of steam,\\ngas, or oil engine, electric motors can be employed without\\nthe slightest difficulty. In order to realize this, one only\\nhas to think of the positions in which electrically-driven\\nventilating fans are placed, or of the unpleasantly familiar74\\nelectric drill of the dentist. An electric motor is small and\\ncompact, gives off no fumes and practically no heat, makes\\nvery little noise, is capable of running for very long periods\\nat high speed and with the utmost steadiness, and requires\\nextremely little attention.',\n",
       " 'It is apparently a very simple matter to fit up a power\\nstation with a number of very large dynamos driven by\\npowerful engines, and to distribute the current produced by\\nthese dynamos to all parts of a town or district by means\\nof cables, but as a matter of fact it is a fairly complicated\\nengineering problem. First of all the source of power for\\ndriving the dynamos has to be considered. In private and\\nother small power plants, gas, petrol or oil engines are\\ngenerally used, but for large stations the choice lies between\\nsteam and water power. In this country steam power is\\nused almost exclusively. Formerly the ordinary reciprocating\\nsteam engines were always employed, and though these\\nare still in very extensive use, they are being superseded in\\nmany cases by steam turbines. The turbine is capable of\\nrunning at higher speeds than the reciprocating engine, and\\nat the greatest speeds it runs with a great deal less noise,\\nand with practically no vibration at all. More than this,\\nturbines take up much less room, and require less oil and\\nattendance. The turbines are coupled directly to the\\ndynamos, so that the two machines appear almost as one.\\nIn the power station shown on Plate V. a number of alternating\\ncurrent dynamos coupled to steam turbines are seen.',\n",
       " 'A large power station consumes enormous quantities of\\ncoal, and for convenience of supply it is situated on the\\nbank of a river or canal, or, if neither of these is available,76\\nas close to the railway as possible. The unloading of the\\ncoal barges or trucks is done mechanically, the coal passing\\ninto a large receiving hopper. From here it is taken to\\nanother hopper close to the furnaces by means of coal\\nelevators and conveyors, which consist of a number of\\nbuckets fixed at short intervals on an endless travelling\\nchain. From the furnace hopper the coal is fed into the\\nfurnaces by mechanical stokers, and the resulting ash and\\nclinker falls into a pit below the furnaces, from which it is\\ncarted away.',\n",
       " 'The heat produced in the furnaces is used to generate\\nsteam, and from the boilers the steam passes to the engines\\nalong a steam pipe. After doing its work in the engines,\\nthe steam generally passes to a condenser, in which it is\\ncooled to water, freed from oil and grease, and returned to\\nthe boilers to be transformed once more into steam. As\\nthis water from the condenser is quite warm, less heat is\\nrequired to raise steam from it than would be the case if\\nthe boiler supply were kept up with cold water. The\\npower generated by the engines is used to drive the\\ndynamos, and stout copper cables convey the current from\\nthese to what are called “bus” bars. There are two of\\nthese, one receiving the positive cable from the dynamos,\\nand the other the negative cable, and the bars run from end\\nto end of a large main switchboard. From this switchboard\\nthe current is distributed by other cables known as feeders.',\n",
       " 'The nature of the current generated at a power station\\nis determined to a great extent by the size of the district to\\nbe supplied. Generally speaking, where the current is not\\nto be transmitted beyond a radius of about two miles from\\nthe station, continuous current is generated; while alternating\\ncurrent is employed for the supply of larger areas. In\\nsome cases both kinds of current are generated at one\\nstation.',\n",
       " 'If continuous current is to be used, it is generated\\nusually at a pressure of from 400 to 500 volts, the average\\nbeing about 440 volts; and the supply is generally on what\\nis known as the three-wire system. Three separate wires\\nare employed. The two outer wires are connected\\nrespectively to the positive and the negative bus bars\\nrunning along the main switchboard, these bars receiving\\npositive or negative current directly from the dynamos.\\nThe outer wires therefore carry current at the full voltage\\nof the system. Between them is a third and smaller wire,\\nconnected to a third bar, much smaller than the outer bars,\\nand known as the mid-wire bar. This bar is not connected\\nto the dynamos, but to earth, by means of a large plate of\\ncopper sunk into the ground. Connexion between the\\nmid-wire bar and the outer bars is made by two machines\\ncalled “balancers,” one connecting the mid-wire bar and the\\npositive bus bar, and the other the mid-wire bar and the\\nnegative bus bar. If the pressure between the outer bars\\nis 440 volts, then the pressure between the mid-wire bar and\\neither of the outer bars will be 220 volts, that is just half.',\n",
       " 'The balancers serve the purpose of balancing the\\nvoltage on each side, and they are machines capable of\\nacting either as motors or dynamos. In order to comply\\nwith Board of Trade regulations, electric appliances of all\\nkinds intended for ordinary domestic purposes, including\\nlamps, and heating and cooking apparatus, are supplied\\nwith current at a pressure not exceeding 250 volts. In a\\nsystem such as we are describing, all these appliances are\\nconnected between the mid-wire and one or other of the\\nouter wires, thus receiving current at 220 volts. In\\npractice it is impossible to arrange matters so that the\\nlamps and other appliances connected with the positive side\\nof the system shall always take the same amount of current\\nas those connected with the negative side, and there is78\\nalways liable to be a much greater load on one side or the\\nother. If, for instance, a heavy load is thrown on the\\nnegative side, the voltage on that side will drop. The\\nbalancer on the positive side then acts as an electric motor,\\ndrives the balancer on the negative side as a dynamo, and\\nthus provides the current required to raise the voltage on\\nthe negative side until the balance is restored. The working\\nof the balancers, which need not be described in further\\ndetail, is practically automatic. Electric motors, for driving\\nelectric trams or machinery of any kind, are connected\\nbetween the outer wires, so that they receive the full 440\\nvolts of the system.',\n",
       " 'In any electric supply system the demand for current\\ndoes not remain constant, but fluctuates more or less. For\\ninstance, in a system including an electric tramway, if a car\\nbreaks down and remains a fixture for a short time, all cars\\nbehind it are held up, and a long line of cars is quickly\\nformed. When the breakdown is repaired, all the cars\\nstart practically at the same instant, and consequently a\\nsudden and tremendous demand for current is made. In a\\nvery large tramway system in a fairly level city, the\\nfluctuations in the demand for current, apart from accidents,\\nare not very serious, for they tend to average themselves;\\nbut in a small system, and particularly if the district is hilly,\\nthe fluctuations are very great, and the current demand\\nmay vary as much as from 400 to 2000 amperes. Again,\\nin a system supplying power and light, the current demand\\nrises rapidly as the daylight fails on winter afternoons,\\nbecause, while workshop and other motors are still in full\\nswing, thousands of electric lamps are switched on more or\\nless at the same time. The power station must be able to\\ndeal with any exceptional demands which are likely to\\noccur, and consequently more current must be available\\nthan is actually required under average conditions. Instead79\\nof having generating machinery large enough to meet all\\nunusual demands, the generators at a station using continuous\\ncurrent may be only of sufficient size to supply a little\\nmore than the average demand, any current beyond this\\nbeing supplied by a battery of storage cells. The battery\\nis charged during periods when the demand for current is\\nsmall, and when a heavy load comes on, the current from\\nthe battery relieves the generators of the sudden strain.\\nTo be of any service for such a purpose the storage battery\\nof course must be very large. Plate VI. shows a large\\nbattery of no cells, and some idea of the size of the\\nindividual cells may be obtained from the fact that each\\nweighs about 3900 lb.',\n",
       " 'Alternating current is produced at almost all power\\nstations supplying large districts. It is generated at high\\npressure, from 2000 volts upwards, the highest pressure\\nemployed in this country being about 11,000 volts. Such\\npressures are of course very much too high for electric\\nlamps or motors, and the object of generating current of\\nthis kind is to secure the greatest economy in transmission\\nthrough the long cables. Electric energy is measured in\\nwatts, the watts being obtained by multiplying together\\nthe pressure or voltage of the current, and its rate of flow\\nor amperage. From this it will be seen that, providing the\\nproduct of voltage and amperage remains the same, it\\nmakes no difference, so far as electric energy is concerned,\\nwhether the current be of high voltage and low amperage,\\nor of low voltage and high amperage. Now in transmitting\\na current through a long cable, there is a certain\\namount of loss due to the heating of the conductor. This\\nheating is caused by the current flow, not by the pressure;\\nand the heavier the current, the greater the heating, and\\nthe greater the loss. This being so, it is clear that by\\ndecreasing the current flow, and correspondingly increasing80\\nthe pressure, the loss in transmission will be reduced; and\\nthis is why alternating current is generated at high pressure\\nwhen it is to be transmitted to a distance.',\n",
       " 'The kind of alternating current generated is usually\\nthat known as three-phase current. Formerly single-phase\\ncurrent was in general use, but it has been superseded by\\nthree-phase current because the latter is more economical\\nto generate and to distribute, and also more satisfactory for\\nelectric motors. The actual voltage of the current sent out\\nfrom the station varies according to the distance to which\\nthe current is to be conveyed. In the United States and\\nin other countries where current has to be conveyed to\\nplaces a hundred or even more miles from the station,\\npressures as high as 120,000 volts are in use. It is possible\\nto produce alternating current at such pressures directly\\nfrom the dynamos, but in practice this is never done, on\\naccount of the great liability to breakdown of the insulation.\\nInstead, the current is generated at from 2000 to 10,000 or\\n11,000 volts, and raised to the required pressure, before\\nleaving the station, by means of a step-up transformer.\\nWe have seen that an induction coil raises, or steps up, the\\nvoltage of the current supplied to it. A step-up transformer\\nworks on the same principle as the induction coil, and in\\npassing through it the current is raised in voltage, but\\ncorrespondingly lowered in amperage. Of course, if the\\npressure of the current generated by the dynamos is already\\nsufficiently high to meet the local requirements, the transformer\\nis not used.',\n",
       " 'For town supply the current from the power station is\\nled along underground cables to a number of sub-stations,\\nsituated in different parts of the town, and generally underground.\\nAt each sub-station the current passes through a\\nstep-down transformer, which also acts on the principle of the\\ninduction coil, but in the reverse way, so that the voltage is\\nlowered instead of being raised. From the transformer the\\ncurrent emerges at the pressure required for use, but it is\\nstill alternating current; and if it is desired to have a\\ncontinuous-current supply this alternating current must be\\nconverted. One of the simplest arrangements for this\\npurpose consists of an electric motor and a dynamo, the\\ntwo being coupled together. The motor is constructed to\\nrun on the alternating current from the transformer, and\\nit drives the dynamo, which is arranged to generate continuous\\ncurrent. There is also a machine called a “rotary\\nconverter,” which is largely used instead of the motor\\ngenerator.

       " 'The superiority of the trolley system lies in the fact that\\nit is cheaper to construct and to maintain than the other\\ntwo, and also in its much greater reliability under all\\nworking conditions. The overhead wire is not one continuous\\ncable, but is divided into sections of about half a\\nmile in length, each section being supplied with current\\nfrom a separate main. At each point where the current\\nis fed to the trolley wire a sort of metal box may be seen\\nat the side of the street. These boxes are called “feeder\\npillars,” and each contains a switch by means of which the\\ncurrent can be cut off from that particular section, for\\nrepairing or other purposes. Above the car is fixed an arm\\nprovided with a trolley wheel which runs along the wire,\\nand this wheel takes the current from the wire. From the\\nwheel the current passes down the trolley arm to the\\ncontroller, which is operated by the driver, and from there\\nto the motors beneath the car. Leaving the motors it\\npasses to the wheels and then to the rails, from which it\\nis led off at intervals by cables and so returned to the\\ngenerating station.

When the car is started the motors are\\nconnected in series, so that the full current passes through\\neach, while the pressure is divided between them; but\\nwhen the car is well on the move the controller connects\\nthe motors in parallel, so that each receives the full pressure\\nof the current.',\n",

These switches are arranged to be moved by\\nmagnets fixed beneath the car, and thus when the car\\npasses over a stud the magnets work the switch and connect\\nthe stud to the conductors, so that the stud is then\\n“alive.” The current is taken from the studs by means of\\nsliding brushes or skates which are carried by the car.\\nThe studs are thus alive only when the car is passing over86\\nthem, and at all other times they are dead, and not in any\\nway dangerous.',\n",

These brakes are operated by electro-magnets\\nof great power, the current necessary to excite the\\nmagnets being taken from the motors. Finally there is\\na most interesting and ingenious method of regenerative\\ncontrol.

When a train\\ncontains two or more motor-cars all the controllers, which\\nare very similar to those on electric tramcars, are electrically\\nconnected so as to be worked together from one\\nmaster controller. This system allows the length of the\\ntrain to be adjusted to the number of passengers, so that\\nno power is wasted in running empty cars during periods\\nof small traffic. In suburban railways, where the stopping-places\\nare many and close together, the efficiency of the\\nservice depends to a large extent upon the time occupied\\nin bringing the trains from rest to full speed. In this\\nrespect the electric train has a great advantage over the89\\nordinary train hauled by a steam locomotive, for it can\\npick up speed at three or more times the rate of the latter,\\nthus enabling greater average speeds and a more frequent\\nservice to be maintained.',\n",

A section of the London, Brighton, and South\\nCoast Railway is electrically operated by alternating\\ncurrent, the kind of current used being that known as\\nsingle-phase. The overhead system is used, and the\\ncurrent is led to the wire at a pressure of about 6000 volts.\\nThis current is collected by sliding bows and conveyed to\\ntransformers carried on the trains, from which it emerges\\nat a pressure of about 300 volts, and is then sent through\\nthe motors. The overhead wires are not fixed directly to\\nthe supports as in the case of overhead tramway wires, but\\ninstead two steel cables are carried by the supports, and\\nthe live wires are hung from these. The effect of this\\narrangement is to make the sliding bows run steadily and\\nevenly along the wires without jumping or jolting.

Many attempts have been made to apply\\naccumulator traction to electric tramway systems, but they\\nhave all failed, and the idea has been abandoned. There\\nare many reasons for the failure of these attempts. The\\nweight of a battery of accumulators large enough to run a\\ncar with a load of passengers is tremendous, and this is\\nof course so much dead weight to be hauled along, and it\\nbecomes a very serious matter when steep hills have to be\\nnegotiated. When a car is started on a steep up-gradient\\na sudden and heavy demand for current is made, and this\\nputs upon the accumulators a strain which they are not91\\nable to bear without injury. Another great drawback is\\nthe comparatively short time for which accumulators can\\ngive a heavy current, for this necessitates the frequent\\nreturn of the cars to the central station in order to have\\nthe batteries re-charged. Finally, accumulators are sensitive\\nthings, and the continuous heavy vibration of a tramcar\\nis ruinous to them.',\n",

The electric\\nautomobile is superior to the petrol-driven car in its delightfully\\neasy and silent running, and its freedom from all\\nobjectionable smells. On the other hand high speeds\\ncannot be attained, and there is the trouble of having the\\naccumulators re-charged, but for city work this is not a\\nserious matter. Two sets of accumulators are used, so that\\none can be left at the garage to be charged while the other\\nis in use, the replacing of the exhausted set by the freshly\\ncharged one being a matter of only a few minutes. The\\npetrol-driven car is undoubtedly superior in every way for\\ntouring purposes.

He was an indefatigable experimenter, and in\\norder to help on his work the Institution placed at his\\ndisposal a very large voltaic battery consisting of 2000\\ncells. In 1802 he found that if two rods of carbon, one\\nconnected to each terminal of his great battery, were\\nfirst made to touch one another and then gradually\\nseparated, a brilliant arch of light was formed between\\nthem. The intense brilliance of this electric arch, or arc\\nas it came to be called, naturally suggested the possibility\\nof utilizing Davy’s discovery for lighting purposes, but the\\nmaintaining of the necessary current proved a serious\\nobstacle. The first cost of a battery of the required size\\nwas considerable, but this was a small matter compared\\nwith the expense of keeping the cells in good working\\norder. Several very ingenious and more or less efficient\\narc lamps fed by battery current were produced by various\\ninventors, but for the above reason they were of little use\\nexcept for experimental purposes, and the commercial\\nsuccess of the arc lamp was an impossibility until the\\ndynamo came to be a really reliable source of current.\\nSince that time innumerable shapes and forms of arc lamps94\\nhave been devised, while the use of such lamps has increased\\nby leaps and bounds. To-day, wherever artificial\\nillumination on a large scale is required, there the arc lamp\\nis to be found.',\n",

When the carbons\\nare placed horizontally, the glowing mass is carried upwards\\nby the ascending currents of heated air, and it assumes the\\narch-like form from which it gets its name. If the carbons\\nare vertical the curve is not produced, a more or less\\nstraight line being formed instead. The electric arc may be\\nformed between any conducting substances, but for practical\\nlighting purposes carbon is found to be most suitable.',\n",
       " 'Either continuous or alternating currents may be used\\nto form the arc. With continuous current, if the carbon\\nrods are fully exposed to the air, they gradually consume\\naway, and minute particles of carbon are carried across\\nfrom the positive rod to the negative rod, so that the former\\nwastes at about twice the rate of the latter. The end of\\nthe positive rod becomes hollowed out so as to resemble a\\nlittle crater, and the end of the negative rod becomes more\\nor less pointed. The fact that with continuous current the\\npositive rod consumes away twice as fast as the negative\\nrod, may be taken advantage of to decrease the cost of new\\ncarbons, by replacing the wasted positive rod with a new\\none, and using the unconsumed portion of the old positive\\nrod as a new negative rod.1 If alternating current is used,\\neach rod in turn becomes the positive rod, so that no crater95\\nis formed, and both the carbons have the same shape and\\nare consumed at the same rate. A humming noise is liable\\nto be produced by the alternating current arc, but by careful\\nconstruction of the lamp this noise is reduced to the\\nminimum.',\n",

       " 'Arc lamp carbons may be either solid or cored. The\\nsolid form is made entirely of very hard carbon, while the\\ncored form consists of a narrow tube of carbon filled up with\\nsoft graphite. Cored carbons usually burn more steadily\\nthan the solid form. In what are known as flame arc\\nlamps the carbons are impregnated with certain metallic\\nsalts, such as calcium. These lamps give more light for\\nthe same amount of current. The arc is long and flame-like,\\nand usually of a striking yellow colour, but it is not so\\nsteady as the ordinary arc.',\n",
       " 'As the carbon rods waste away, the length of the arc\\nincreases, and if this increase goes beyond a certain limit\\nthe arc breaks and the current ceases. If the arc is to be\\nkept going for any length of time some arrangement for\\npushing the rods closer together must be provided, in order\\nto counteract the waste. In arc lamps this pushing together,\\nor “feeding” as it is called, is done automatically, as\\nis also the first bringing together and separating of the rods\\nto start or strike the arc. Fig. 21 shows a simple arrangement\\nfor this purpose. A is the positive carbon, and B\\nthe negative. C is the holder for the positive carbon, and\\nthis is connected to the rod D, which is made of soft iron.96\\nThis rod is wound with two separate coils of wire as shown,\\ncoil E having a low resistance, and coil F a high one.\\nThese two coils are solenoids, and D is the core,\\n(Chapter VII.). When the lamp is not in use, the weight of\\nthe holder keeps the positive carbon in contact with the\\nnegative carbon. When switched on, the current flows\\nalong the cable to the point H. Here it has two paths\\nopen to it, one through coil E to the positive carbon, and\\nthe other through coil F and back to the source of supply.\\nBut coil E has a much lower\\nresistance than coil F, and\\nso most of the current\\nchooses the easier path\\nthrough E, only a small\\namount of current taking\\nthe path through the other\\ncoil. Both coils are now\\nmagnetized, and E tends to\\ndraw the rod D upwards,\\nwhile F tends to pull it\\ndownwards. Coil E, however,\\nhas much greater power\\nthan coil F, because a much\\nlarger amount of current is\\npassing through it; and so it overcomes the feeble pull of F,\\nand draws up the rod. The raising of D lifts the positive\\ncarbon away from the negative carbon, and the arc is struck.\\nThe carbons now begin to waste away, and very slowly the\\ndistance between them increases. The path of the current\\npassing through coil E is from carbon A to carbon B by\\nway of the arc, and as the length of the gap between A\\nand B increases, the resistance of this path also increases.\\nThe way through coil E thus becomes less easy, and as\\ntime goes on more and more current takes the alternative97\\npath through coil F. This results in a decrease in the\\nmagnetism of E, and an increase in that of F, and at a\\ncertain point F becomes the more powerful of the two, and\\npulls down the rod. In this way the positive carbon is\\nlowered and brought nearer to the negative carbon.\\nDirectly the diminishing distance between A and B reaches\\na certain limit, coil E once more asserts its superiority, and\\nby overcoming the pull of F it stops the further approach\\nof the carbons. So, by the opposing forces of the two\\ncoils, the carbons are maintained between safe limits, in\\nspite of their wasting away.',\n",

In lamps\\nfor interior lighting the arrangement is frequently reversed,\\nso that the positive carbon is below. Most of the light is\\nthus directed upwards, and if the ceiling is fairly low and98\\nof a white colour the rays are reflected by it, and a soft and\\nevenly diffused lighting is the result.

The absence of red rays\\nalters colour-values greatly, scarlet objects appearing\\nblack; and on this account it is impossible to match colours\\nby this light. In many respects, however, the deficiency\\nin red rays is a great positive advantage. Every one who\\nhas worked by mercury vapour light must have noticed\\nthat it enables very fine details to be seen with remarkable\\ndistinctness. This property is due to an interesting fact.\\nDaylight and ordinary artificial light is a compound or\\nmixture of rays of different colours. It is a well-known\\noptical fact that a simple lens is unable to bring all these\\nrays to the same focus; so that if we sharply focus an image\\nby red light, it is out of focus or blurred by blue light. This\\ndefect of the lens is called “chromatic aberration.” The\\neye too suffers from chromatic aberration, so that it cannot\\nfocus sharply all the different rays at the same time. The\\nviolet rays are brought to a focus considerably in front of\\nthe red rays, and the green and the yellow rays come in\\nbetween the two. The eye therefore automatically and102\\nunconsciously effects a compromise, and focuses for the\\ngreenish-yellow rays. The mercury vapour light consists\\nvery largely of these rays, and consequently it enables the\\nimage to be focused with greater sharpness; or, in other\\nwords, it increases the acuteness of vision. Experiments\\ncarried out by Dr. Louis Bell and Dr. C.\\xa0H. Williams\\ndemonstrated this increase in visual sharpness very conclusively.\\nType, all of exactly the same size, was examined\\nby mercury vapour light, and by the light from an electric\\nincandescent lamp with tungsten filament. The feeling of\\nsharper definition produced by the mercury vapour light\\nwas so strong that many observers were certain that the\\ntype was larger, and they were convinced that it was\\nexactly the same only after careful personal examination.',\n",

The first and the greatest\\ndifficulty was that of finding a substance which could be\\nformed into a fine filament, and which could be kept\\nin a state of incandescence without melting or burning\\naway. Platinum was first chosen, on account of its very\\nhigh melting-point, and the fact that it was not acted\\nupon by the gases of the air.

The ends of the spiral were\\nconnected to outside wires sealed into the bulb. It was\\nfound, however, that keeping platinum continuously at a\\nhigh temperature caused it to disintegrate slowly, so that\\nthe lamps had only a short life. Fine threads or filaments\\nof carbon were then tried, and found to be much more\\ndurable, besides being a great deal cheaper. The carbon\\nfilament lamp quickly became a commercial success, and\\nup to quite recent years it was the only form of electric\\nincandescent lamp in general use.',\n",

Early in\\n1911 lamps having a filament consisting of a single continuous\\npiece of drawn tungsten wire were produced. It\\nhad been known for some time that although tungsten was\\nso brittle at ordinary temperatures, it became quite soft\\nand flexible when heated to incandescence in the lamp, and\\nthat it lost this quality again as soon as it cooled down.\\nA process was discovered by which the metal could be\\nmade permanently ductile, by mechanical treatment while\\nin the heated state. In this process pure tungsten powder\\nis pressed into rods and then made coherent by heating.\\nWhile still hot it is hammered, and finally drawn out into\\nfine wires through diamond dies. The wire is no thicker\\nthan a fine hair, and it varies in size from about 0·012 mm.\\nto about 0·375 mm., according to the amount of current it\\nis intended to take. It is mounted by winding it continuously\\nzigzag shape round a glass carrier, which has at\\nthe top and the bottom a number of metal supports\\narranged in the form of a star, and insulated by a central\\nrod of glass. One star is made of strong, stiff material,105\\nand the other consists of fine wires of some refractory\\nmetal, molybdenum being used in the Osram lamps.\\nThese supports act as springs, and keep the wire securely\\nin its original shape, no matter in what position the lamp\\nis used.

The watt is the standard of electrical\\nenergy, and it is the rate of work represented by a current\\nof one ampere at a pressure of 1 volt.

If a lamp\\ndesigned for, say, 8 volts, is used on a circuit of\\n32 volts, its candle-power is greatly increased, while the\\namount of current consumed is not increased in proportion.\\nIn this way the lamp becomes a more efficient source\\nof light, but the “over-running,” as it is called, has a\\ndestructive effect on the filament, so that the life of the\\nlamp is greatly shortened. In the Dussaud system however\\nthe time during which each lamp has current passing\\nthrough it is so short, followed by a period of rest, that\\nthe destructive effect of over-running is reduced to the\\nminimum; so that by using very high voltages an extremely\\nbrilliant light is safely obtained with a comparatively\\nsmall consumption of current. It might be thought\\nthat the constant interchange of lamps would result in an\\nunsteady effect, but the substitution of one lamp for another\\nis carried out so rapidly that the eye gets the impression of\\nperfect steadiness. The Dussaud system is of little use107\\nfor ordinary lighting purposes, but for lighthouse illumination,\\nphotographic studio work, and the projection of\\nlantern slides and cinematograph films, it appears to be of\\nconsiderable value.',\n",
       " 'Electric light has many advantages over all other\\nilluminants. It gives off very little heat, and does not use\\nup the oxygen in the air of a room as gas does; while by\\nmeans of flexible wires the lamps can be put practically\\nanywhere, so that the light may be had just where it is\\nwanted. Another great advantage is that the light may be\\nswitched on without any trouble about matches, and there\\nis none of the danger from fire which always exists with\\na flame.',\n",

This is\\nsimilar in working to the ordinary Leclanché cell used for\\nbells, but the carbon mixture is placed in a canvas bag or\\nsack, instead of in a porous pot, and the zinc rod is replaced\\nby a sheet of zinc surrounding the sack. These cells give108\\nabout 1½ volt each, so that four, connected in series,\\nare required to light a 6-volt lamp. The lamps must\\ntake only a very small current, or the cells will fail\\nquickly. Small metal filament lamps taking from a third\\nto half an ampere are made specially for this purpose, and\\nthese always should be used. A battery of sack Leclanché\\ncells with a miniature lamp of this kind forms a convenient\\noutfit for use as a night-light, or for lighting a dark cupboard,\\npassage or staircase. Lamps with ruby glass, or\\nwith a ruby cap to slip over the bulb, may be obtained for\\nphotographic purposes. If the outfit is wanted for use as\\na reading-lamp it is better to have two separate batteries,\\nand to use them alternately for short periods.

       " 'It will be of interest to mention now one or two of\\nthe uses of electric furnaces. The well-known substance\\ncalcium carbide, so much used for producing acetylene gas\\nfor lighting purposes, is a compound of calcium and\\ncarbon; it is made by raising a mixture of lime and coke\\nto an intense heat in an electric furnace. The manufacture\\nof calcium carbide is carried on on a very large scale at\\nNiagara, with electric power obtained from the Falls, and\\nat Odda in Norway, where the power is supplied by the\\nriver Tysse. Carborundum, a substance almost as hard\\nas the diamond, is largely used for grinding and polishing\\npurposes. It is manufactured by sending a strong current\\nthrough a furnace containing a core of coke surrounded by\\na mixture of sand, sawdust, and carbon. The core becomes\\nincandescent, and the heating is continued until the\\ncarbon combines with the sand, the process taking about\\na day. Graphite, a kind of carbon, occurs naturally in the\\nform of plumbago, which is used for making black lead\\npencils. It is obtained by mining, but many of the mines113\\nare already worked out, and others will be exhausted\\nbefore long. By means of the electric furnace, graphite\\ncan now be made artificially, by heating anthracite\\ncoal, and at Niagara a quantity running into thousands\\nof tons is produced every year.

       " 'A chapter on electric heating would not be complete\\nwithout some mention of electric welding. Welding is the\\nprocess of uniting two pieces of metal by means of a combination\\nof heat and pressure, so that a strong and permanent\\njoint is produced. The chief difficulty in welding is\\nthat of securing and keeping up the proper temperature,\\nand some metals are much more troublesome than others\\nin this respect. Platinum, iron, and steel are fairly easy to\\nweld, but most of the other metals, and alloys of different\\nmetals, require very exact regulation of temperature. It\\nis almost impossible to obtain this exact regulation by\\nordinary methods of heating, but the electric current makes\\nit a comparatively easy matter. The principle of ordinary\\nelectric welding is very simple. The ends of the two\\npieces of metal are placed together, and a powerful current\\nis passed through them. This current meets with a high\\nresistance at the point of contact of the two pieces, and so\\nheat is produced. When the proper welding temperature\\nis reached, and the metal is in a sort of pasty condition,\\nthe two pieces are pressed strongly together, and the\\ncurrent is switched off. The pieces are now firmly united\\ntogether. The process may be carried out by hand, the\\nwelding smith switching the current on and off, and applying\\npressure at the right moment by means of hydraulic\\npower. There are also automatic welders, which perform\\nthe same operations without requiring any manual control.\\nAlternating current is used, of low voltage but very high\\namperage.',\n",

       " 'The most familiar of all electrically worked appliances is\\nprobably the electric bell, which in some form or other is\\nin use practically all over the world. Electric bells are\\noperated by means of a current of electricity sent through\\nthe coils of an electro-magnet, and one of the very simplest\\nforms is that known as the single-stroke bell. In this bell\\nan armature or piece of soft iron is placed across, but at a\\nlittle distance from, the poles of an electro-magnet, and to\\nthis piece of iron is fixed a lever terminating in a sort of\\nknob which lies close to a bell or gong. When a current\\nis sent round the electro-magnet the armature is attracted,\\nso that the lever moves forward and strikes a sharp blow\\nupon the gong. Before the gong can be sounded a second\\ntime the current must be interrupted in order to make the\\nmagnet release the armature, so that the lever may fall\\nback to its original position. Thus the bell gives only one\\nring each time the circuit is closed. Bells of this kind may\\nbe used for signalling in exactly the same way as the Morse\\nsounder, and sometimes they are made with two gongs of\\ndifferent tones, which are arranged so as to be sounded\\nalternately.',\n",
       " 'For most purposes however another form called the\\ntrembler bell is much more convenient. Fig. 24 is a rough\\ndiagram of the usual arrangement of the essential parts of\\na trembler bell. When the circuit is closed by pressing the117\\nbell-push, a current flows from the battery to the electro-magnet\\nEE, by way of terminal T. The electro-magnet\\nthen attracts the soft iron armature\\nA, thus causing the hammer H to\\nstrike the gong. But immediately\\nthe armature is pulled away from\\nthe terminal T¹ the circuit is\\nbroken and the magnet loses its\\nattraction for the armature, which\\nis moved back again into contact\\nwith T¹ by the spring S. The\\ncircuit is thus again closed, the\\narmature is again attracted, and\\nthe hammer strikes the gong a\\nsecond time. This process goes\\non over and over again at a great\\nspeed as long as the bell-push is\\nkept pressed down, resulting in\\nan extremely rapid succession of\\nstrokes upon the gong. It will\\nbe noticed that the working of\\nthis bell is very similar to that of the automatic contact-breaker\\nused for induction coils (Chapter VIII.). For\\nhousehold purposes this\\nform of bell has completely\\ndriven out the once popular\\nwire-pulled bell. Bell-pushes\\nare made in a\\nnumber of shapes and\\nforms, and Fig. 25 will\\nmake clear the working\\nprinciple of the familiar form which greets us from almost\\nevery doorway with the invitation, “Press.” In private\\noffices and elsewhere the rather aggressive sound of an118\\nordinary trembler bell is apt to become a nuisance, and\\nin such cases a modified form which gives a quiet buzzing\\nsound is often employed.',\n",
       " 'It is frequently necessary to have an electric bell which,\\nwhen once started, will continue ringing until it is stopped.\\nSuch bells are used for fire and burglar alarms and for\\nmany other similar purposes, and they are called continuous-ringing\\nbells as distinguished from the ordinary\\ntrembler bells. In one common form of continuous-ringing\\nbell two separate batteries are used, one to start the bell\\nand the other to keep it ringing. When a momentary\\ncurrent from the first battery is sent over the bell lines the\\narmature is attracted by the electro-magnet, and its movement\\nallows a lever to fall upon a metal contact piece.\\nThis closes the circuit of the second battery, which keeps\\nthe bell ringing until the lever is replaced by pulling a cord\\nor pressing a knob. Continuous-ringing bells are often\\nfitted to alarm clocks. The alarm is set in the usual way,\\nand at the appointed hour the bell begins to ring, and goes\\non ringing until its owner, able to stand the noise no longer,\\ngets out of bed to stop it.',\n",

Before reaching the bell the wire\\nfrom each bell-push passes round a separate small electro-magnet,\\nwhich is thus magnetized by the current at the\\nsame time that the bell is rung. In the simplest form of\\nindicator the attraction of the magnet causes a little flag to\\nswing backwards and forwards over its number. Another\\nform is the drop indicator, in which the movement of the\\narmature when attracted by the magnet allows a little flag\\nto drop, thus exposing the number of the room from which\\nthe bell was rung. The dropped flag has to be replaced,\\neither by means of a knob fixed to a rod which pushes the\\nflag up again, or by pressing a push which sends the\\ncurrent through another little electro-magnet so arranged\\nas to re-set the flag.',\n",

Other contacts are concealed\\nunder the doormats, and under the carpets in passages and\\nstairways, so that the burglar is practically certain to tread\\non one or other of them and so rouse the house.

The\\nmethod is similar to that used for hourly corrections, the\\nmain difference being that the circuit is closed by the\\npendulum of the master-clock at each end of its swing, so\\nthat the pendulums of the sub-clocks are accelerated or\\nheld back as may be required.',\n",
       " 'In the correcting systems already described the sub-clocks\\nare complete in themselves, so that they work quite\\nindependently, except at the instant of correction. For\\nhotels, schools, and other large buildings requiring clocks127\\nat a number of different points, a simpler arrangement is\\nadopted. Only one complete clock is used, this being the\\nmaster-clock, which may be wound either electrically or by\\nkey. The sub-clocks are dummies, having only a dial with\\nits hands, and an electro-magnetic arrangement behind the\\ndial for moving the hands. The sub-clocks are electrically\\nconnected with the master-clock, and the mechanism of this\\nclock is arranged to close the circuit automatically every\\nhalf-minute. Each time this occurs the magnet of each\\nsub-clock moves forward the hands half a minute, and in\\nthis way the dummy clocks are made to travel on together\\nby half-minute steps, exactly in unison with the master-clock.',\n",
       " 'We come now to one of the most important inventions of\\nthe nineteenth century, the electric telegraph. From very\\nearly times men have felt the necessity for some means of\\nrapidly communicating between two distant points. The\\nfirst really practical method of signalling was that of lighting\\nbeacon fires on the tops of hills, to spread some important\\ntidings, such as the approach of an enemy. From this\\nsimple beginning arose more complicated systems of signalling\\nby semaphore, flags, or flashing lights. All these\\nmethods proved incapable of dealing with the rapidly\\ngrowing requirements of commerce, for they were far too\\nslow in action, and in foggy weather they were of no use\\nat all. We are so accustomed to walking into a telegraph\\noffice, filling up a form, and paying our sixpence or more,\\nthat it is very difficult for us to realize the immense importance\\nof the electric telegraph; and probably the best\\nway of doing this is to try to imagine the state of things\\nwhich would result if the world’s telegraphic instruments\\nwere put out of action for a week or two.',\n",
       " 'The earliest attempts at the construction of an electric\\ntelegraph date back to a time long before the discovery of\\nthe electric current. As early as 1727 it was known that\\nan electric discharge could be transmitted to a considerable\\ndistance through a conducting substance such as a moistened\\nthread or a wire, and this fact suggested the possibility of129\\na method of electric signalling. In 1753 a writer in Scott’s\\nMagazine brought forward an ingenious scheme based upon\\nthe attraction between an electrified body and any light\\nsubstance. His telegraph was worked by an electric\\nmachine, and it consisted of twenty-six separate parallel\\nwires, every wire having a metal ball suspended from it at\\neach end. Close to each ball was placed a small piece of\\npaper upon which was written a letter of the alphabet.\\nWhen any wire was charged, the paper letters at each end\\nof it were attracted towards the metal balls, and in this\\nway words and sentences were spelled out. Many other\\nsystems more or less on the same lines were suggested\\nduring the next fifty years, but although some of them had\\nconsiderable success in an experimental way, they were all\\nfar too unreliable to have any commercial success.',\n",
       " 'With the invention of the voltaic cell, inventors’ ideas\\ntook a new direction. In 1812 a telegraph based upon the\\npower of an electric current to decompose water was\\ndevised by a German named Sömmering. He used a\\nnumber of separate wires, each connected to a gold pin\\nprojecting from below into a glass vessel filled with\\nacidulated water. There were thirty-five wires in all, for\\nletters and numbers, and when a current was sent along\\nany wire bubbles of gas formed at the pin at the end of it,\\nand so the letters or numbers were indicated. This telegraph,\\nlike its predecessors, never came into practical use.\\nOersted’s discovery in 1829 of the production of magnetism\\nby electricity laid the foundation of the first really practical\\nelectric telegraphs, but little progress was made until the\\nappearance of the Daniell cell, in 1836. The earlier forms\\nof voltaic cells polarized so rapidly that it was impossible\\nto obtain a constant current from them, but the non-polarizing\\nDaniell cell at once removed all difficulty in this\\nrespect. In the year 1837 three separate practical telegraphs130\\nwere invented: by Morse in the United States, by\\nWheatstone and Cooke in England, and by Steinheil in\\nMunich.',\n",
       " 'The first telegraph of Wheatstone and Cooke consisted\\nof five magnetic needles\\npivoted on a vertical\\ndial. The letters of the\\nalphabet were marked\\non the dial, and the\\nneedles were deflected\\nby currents made to\\npass through wires by\\nthe depression of keys,\\nso that two needles\\nwould point towards\\nthe required letter.\\nFig. 26 is a sketch of\\nthe dial of this apparatus.\\nThis telegraph was\\ntried successfully on the\\nLondon and North-Western\\nRailway, over\\na wire a mile and a half\\nin length. Wheatstone\\nand Cooke afterwards\\ninvented a single-needle\\ntelegraph in which the\\nletters were indicated\\nby movements of the needle to the right or to the left,\\naccording to the direction of a current sent through a coil\\nof wire. Wheatstone subsequently produced an apparatus\\nwhich printed the letters on paper.',\n",
       " 'In the United States, Morse had thought out a scheme\\nof telegraphy in 1832, but it was not until 1837 that he got131\\nhis apparatus into working order. He was an artist by\\nprofession, and for a long time he was unable to develop\\nhis ideas for lack of money. After many efforts he succeeded\\nin obtaining a State grant of £6000 for the\\nconstruction of a telegraph line between Baltimore and\\nWashington, and the first message over this line was sent\\nin 1844, the line being thrown open to the public in the\\nfollowing year. Amongst the features of this telegraph\\nwere a receiving instrument which automatically recorded\\nthe messages on a moving paper ribbon, by means of a\\npencil actuated by an electro-magnet; and an apparatus\\ncalled a relay, which enabled the recording instrument to\\nbe worked when the current was enfeebled by the resistance\\nof a very long wire. Morse also devised a telegraphic\\ncode which is practically the same as that in use to-day.',\n",
       " 'The great discovery of the German Steinheil was that\\na second wire for the return of the current was not necessary,\\nand that the earth could be used for this part of the circuit.',\n",
       " 'In reading the early history of great inventions one is\\ncontinually struck with the indifference or even hostility\\nshown by the general public. In England the electric\\ntelegraph was practically ignored until the capture of a\\nmurderer by means of it literally forced the public to see\\nits value. The murder was committed near Slough, and\\nthe murderer succeeded in taking train for London.\\nFortunately the Great Western Railway had a telegraph\\nline between Slough and London, and a description telegraphed\\nto Paddington enabled the police to arrest the\\nmurderer on his arrival. In the United States too there\\nwas just the same indifference. The rate for messages on\\nthe line between Baltimore and Washington was one cent\\nfor four words, and the total amount taken during the first\\nfour days was one cent!',\n",
       " 'One of the simplest forms of telegraph is the single-needle132\\ninstrument. This consists of a magnetic needle\\nfixed to a spindle at the back of an upright board through\\nwhich the spindle is passed. On the same spindle, but in\\nfront of the board, is fixed a dial needle, which, of course,\\nmoves along with the magnetic needle. A coil of wire is\\npassed round the magnetic needle, and connected to a\\ncommutator for reversing\\nthe direction of the\\ncurrent. By turning a\\nhandle to the left a\\ncurrent is made to flow\\nthrough the coil, and\\nthe magnetic needle\\nmoves to one side; but\\nif the handle is turned\\nto the right the current\\nflows through the coil\\nin the opposite direction,\\nand the needle\\nmoves to the other\\nside. Instead of a\\nhandle, two keys may\\nbe used, the movement\\nof the needle varying\\naccording to which key\\nis pressed. A good\\noperator can transmit\\nat the rate of about twenty words a minute with this\\ninstrument. The Morse code, which consists of combinations\\nof dots and dashes, is used, a movement of the\\ndial needle to the left meaning a dot, and one to the right\\na dash. The code as used in the single-needle instrument\\nis shown in Fig. 27.',\n",
       " 'Needle instruments are largely used in railway signal133\\ncabins, but for general telegraphic work an instrument\\ncalled the Morse sounder is employed. This consists of\\nan electro-magnet which, when a current is passed through\\nit, attracts a small piece of iron fixed to one end of a\\npivoted lever. The other end of this lever moves between\\ntwo stops. At the transmitting station the operator closes\\na battery circuit by pressing a key, when the electro-magnet\\nof the sounder at the receiving station attracts the iron,\\nand the lever flies from one stop to the other with a sharp\\nclick, returning again as soon as the circuit is broken. A\\ndot is signalled when the lever falls back immediately after\\nthe click, and a dash when it makes a short stay before\\nreturning. Fig. 28 shows the code of signals for the\\nMorse telegraph.',\n",
       " 'In passing through a very long wire an electric current\\nbecomes greatly reduced in strength owing to the resistance\\nof the wire. If two telegraph stations are a great distance\\napart the energy of the current thus may be unequal to the\\ntask of making the electro-magnet move the lever of the\\nsounder so as to produce a click, but this difficulty is overcome\\nby the use of an ingenious arrangement called a\\n“relay.” It consists of a very small electro-magnet which134\\nattracts a light bar, the movement of the bar being made\\nto close the circuit of another battery at the receiving\\nstation. The feeble current works the relay, and the\\ncurrent in the local circuit operates the sounder.',\n",
       " 'The word “telegraph,” which is derived from the Greek\\ntele, far off, and grapho, I write, strictly signifies writing at\\na distance. The needle instrument and the sounder do not\\nwrite in any way, but by modifying the construction of the\\nsounder it can be made to record the messages it receives.\\nA small wheel is fitted to the free end of the lever of the\\nsounder, and an ink-well is placed so that the wheel dips\\ninto it when the lever is in the normal position. When\\nthe circuit is closed the lever moves just as in the ordinary\\nsounder, but instead of clicking against a stop it presses\\nthe inked wheel against a paper ribbon which is kept\\nslowly moving forward by clockwork. In this way the\\nwheel continues to mark a line along the paper as long as\\nthe circuit remains closed, and according to the time the\\ntransmitting key is kept down a short mark or dot, or a\\nlong mark or dash, is produced. The clockwork which\\nmoves the paper ribbon is started automatically by the\\ncurrent, and it continues working until the message is\\nfinished.',\n",
       " 'A good Morse operator can maintain a speed of about\\nthirty words a minute, but this is far too slow for certain\\nkinds of telegraphic work, such as the transmission of press\\nnews, and for such work the Wheatstone automatic transmitter\\nis used. First of all the messages are punched on\\na paper ribbon. This is done by passing the ribbon from\\nright to left by clockwork through a punching machine\\nwhich is provided with three keys, one for dots, one for\\ndashes, and the other for spaces. If the left-hand key is\\npressed, two holes opposite to one another are made,\\nrepresenting a dot; and if the right-hand key is pressed,136\\ntwo diagonal holes are punched, representing a dash. In\\nFig. 29, which shows a piece of ribbon punched in this\\nway, a third line of holes will be noticed between the outside\\nholes representing the dots and dashes. These holes\\nare for the purpose of guiding the paper ribbon steadily\\nalong through the transmitting machine. The punched\\nribbon is then drawn by clockwork through a Wheatstone\\ntransmitter. In this machine two oscillating needles, connected\\nwith one pole of a battery, are placed below the\\nmoving ribbon. Each time a hole passes, these needles\\nmake contact with a piece of metal connected with the\\nother pole of the battery, thus making and breaking the\\ncircuit with much greater rapidity than is possible with\\nthe Morse key. At the receiving station the messages are\\nrecorded by a form of Morse inker, coming out in dots and\\ndashes as though sent by hand. Below the punched ribbon\\nin Fig. 29 is shown the corresponding arrangement of dots\\nand dashes. The same punched ribbon may be used\\nrepeatedly when the message has to be sent on a number\\nof different lines. The Wheatstone automatic machine is\\ncapable of transmitting at the rate of from 250 to 400\\nwords a minute. Fig. 29 is a fragment of a Daily\\nTelegraph Balkan War special, as transmitted to the\\nYorkshire Post over the latter’s private wire from London\\nto Leeds.

       " 'One weak point of telegraphy with Wheatstone instruments\\nis that the messages are received in Morse\\ncode, and have to be translated.

       " 'In the Pollak-Virag system of telegraphy the action of\\nlight upon sensitized photographic paper is utilized. An\\noperator punches special groupings of holes on a paper\\nribbon about 1 inch wide, by means of a perforating\\nmachine resembling a typewriter, and the ribbon is then\\npassed through a machine which transmits by brush contacts.\\nThe receiver consists of a very small mirror\\nconnected to two vibrating diaphragms, which control its\\nmovements according to the currents received, one diaphragm\\nmoving the mirror in a vertical direction, and the\\nother in a horizontal direction. The mirror reflects a ray\\nof light on to photographic bromide paper in the form of a\\nmoving band about 3 inches in width, and the combined\\naction of the two diaphragms makes the mirror move so\\nthat the ray of light traces out the messages in ordinary\\nalphabetical characters. As it moves forward after being\\nacted upon by the light, the paper is automatically developed\\nand fixed, and then passed through drying rollers. Although\\nthe writing is rather imperfect in formation it is quite legible\\nenough for most messages, but trouble occasionally occurs\\nwith messages containing figures, owing to confusion arising\\nfrom the similarity of the figures, 3, 5, and 8.

       " 'One of the most remarkable of present-day telegraphs\\nis the Creed high-speed automatic printing telegraph.138\\nThis has been devised to do away with hand working as\\nfar as possible, and to substitute quicker and more accurate\\nautomatic methods. In this system a perforated paper\\ntape is produced by a keyboard perforator at the sending\\nstation.

The keyboard contains a separate key for each\\nletter or signal of the Morse code, and the pressing of any\\nkey brings into operation certain punches which make the\\nperforations corresponding to that particular letter. The\\nperforator can be worked by any one who understands how\\nto use an ordinary typewriter, and a speed of about 60\\nwords a minute can be maintained by a fairly skilful\\noperator.

       " 'The tape prepared in this way is passed through a\\nWheatstone transmitter, and long or short currents, according\\nto the arrangement of the perforations, are sent out\\nalong the telegraph line. At the receiving station these\\nsignals operate a receiving perforator. This machine\\nproduces another perforated tape, which is an exact copy\\nof the tape at the sending station, and it turns out this\\nduplicate tape at the rate of from 150 to 200 words a\\nminute. There are two forms of this receiving perforator,\\none worked entirely by electricity, and the other by a combination\\nof electricity and compressed air, both forms\\nserving the same purpose.

       " 'One of the most remarkable features about present-day\\ntelegraphy is the ease with which two or more messages\\ncan be sent simultaneously over one line. Duplex telegraphy,\\nor the simultaneous transmission of two separate\\nmessages in opposite directions over one wire, is now\\npractised on almost every line of any importance. At first\\nsight duplex telegraphy seems to be an impossibility, for if\\nwe have two stations, one at each end of a single wire, and\\neach station fitted with a transmitter and a receiver, it\\nappears as if each transmitter would affect not only the\\nreceiver at the opposite end of the wire, but also the\\nreceiver at its own end, thus causing hopeless confusion\\nwhen both transmitters were in use at the same time.\\nThis actually would be the case with ordinary telegraphic\\nmethods, but by the use of a special arrangement all confusion\\nin working is avoided.',\n",
       " 'We have seen that a magnetic needle is deflected by a\\ncurrent passing through a coil of wire placed round it, and\\nthat the direction in which the needle is deflected depends\\nupon the direction of the current in the coil. Now suppose\\nwe place round the needle two coils of wire, wound so that\\nthe current in one flows in a direction opposite to that of\\nthe current in the other. Then, if we pass two equal\\ncurrents, one through each coil, it is evident that they will140\\nneutralize one another, so that the needle will not be\\ndeflected at all. In a duplex system one end of one of\\nthese coils is connected to earth, say to a copper plate\\nburied in the ground, and one end of the other to the line\\nwire. The two remaining ends are arranged as branches\\nleading off from a single wire connected with the transmitting\\nkey. The whole arrangement of coils and needle\\nis repeated at the other end of the line. If now the\\ntransmitting key at station A is pressed, the circuit is closed\\nand a current flows along the single wire, and then divides\\ninto two where the wire branches, half of it taking the path\\nthrough one coil and half the path through the other.\\nEqual currents thus flow through the oppositely wound\\ncoils, and the needle at station A is not deflected. Leaving\\nthe coils, one of these equal currents flows away to earth,\\nwhile the other passes out along the line wire. On its\\narrival at station B the current is able to pass through only\\none of the coils round the needle, and consequently the\\nneedle is deflected and the signal given. In this way the\\ntransmitting operator at station A is able to signal to station\\nB without affecting the receiver at his own end, and\\nsimilarly the operator at station B can transmit to A without\\naffecting the B receiver. Thus there can be no confusion\\nwhether the transmitters are worked at different times or\\nsimultaneously, for each transmitter affects only the\\nreceiver at the opposite end of the line. The diagram in\\nFig. 30 will help to make clearer the general principle.\\nK and K¹ are the two transmitting keys which close the\\ncircuit, and C and C¹ are the points at which the current\\ndivides into two. Instead of coils and needles, electro-magnets\\noperating sounders may be used, such magnets\\nhaving two separate and oppositely wound coils, acting in\\nexactly the same way as the coils round the needles. The\\nabove description is of course only a rough outline of the141\\nmethod, and in practice matters are more complicated,\\nowing to the necessity for carefully adjusted resistances and\\nfor condensers. There is also another and different method\\nof duplexing a line, but we have not space to describe it.\\nDuplex telegraphy requires two operators at each end of\\nthe line, one to send and the other to receive.',\n",
       " 'Diplex telegraphy is the simultaneous transmission of\\ntwo separate messages in the same direction over one line.\\nWithout going into details it may be said that for this\\npurpose two different transmitting keys are required, one of\\nwhich alters the direction, and the other the strength of the\\ncurrent though the line wire. The receivers are arranged\\nso that one responds only to a strong current, and the other\\nonly to a current in one particular direction. A line also\\nmay be quadruplexed, so that it is possible to transmit\\nsimultaneously two messages from each end, four operators\\nbeing required at each station, two to transmit and two\\nto receive. Systems of multiplex telegraphy have been\\ndevised by which very large numbers of messages can be\\nsent at once over a single wire, and the Baudot multiplex\\ntelegraph has proved very successful.',\n",
       " 'The wires for telegraphic purposes may be conveyed\\neither above or below the ground. Overground wires are142\\ncarried on poles by means of insulators of porcelain or other\\nnon-conducting material, protected by a sort of overhanging\\nscreen. The wires are left bare, and they are generally\\nmade of copper, but iron is used in some cases. In underground\\nlines the wires formerly were insulated by a covering\\nof gutta-percha, but now paper is generally used. Several\\nwires, each covered loosely with thoroughly dry paper, are\\nlaid together in a bundle, the whole bundle or cable being\\nenclosed in a strong lead pipe. The paper coverings are\\nmade to fit loosely so that the wires are surrounded by an\\ninsulating layer of dry air. As many as 1200 separate\\nwires are sometimes enclosed in one pipe. In order to\\nkeep telegraph lines in working order frequent tests are\\nnecessary, and the most important British Postal Telegraph\\nlines are tested once a week between 7.30 and 7.45 a.m.\\nThe earth is generally used for the return circuit in\\ntelegraphy, and the ends of the return wires are connected\\neither to metal plates buried in the ground to a depth at\\nwhich the earth is permanently moist, or to iron gas or\\nwater pipes. The current for telegraph working on a small\\nscale is usually supplied by primary cells, the Daniell cell\\nbeing a favourite for this purpose.

       " 'During the early days of telegraphy, overhead lines\\nwere a source of considerable danger when thunderstorms\\nwere taking place. Lightning flashes often completely\\nwrecked the instruments, giving severe shocks to those in\\nthe vicinity, and in a few cases operators were killed at\\ntheir posts. Danger of this kind is now obviated by the\\nuse of contrivances known as lightning arresters. There\\nare several forms of these, but only one need be mentioned.\\nThe main features of this are two metal plates separated\\nslightly from one another, so that there is a small air gap\\nbetween them. One plate is connected to the line wire,143\\nand the other to earth. Almost all lightning flashes consist\\nof an oscillatory discharge, that is one which passes a\\nnumber of times backwards and forwards between a cloud\\nand the earth. A very rapidly alternating discharge of\\nthis kind finds difficulty in passing along the line wire,\\nbeing greatly impeded by the coils of wire in the various\\npieces of apparatus; and although the resistance of this\\nair gap is very high, the lightning discharge will cross the\\ngap sooner than struggle along the line wire. In this way,\\nwhen a flash affects the line, the discharge jumps the gap\\nbetween the plates of the arrester and passes away harmlessly\\nto earth, without entering the telegraph office at all.\\nAs was mentioned in Chapter III., the prevalence of\\nmagnetic storms sometimes renders telegraph lines quite\\nunworkable for a time, but although such disturbances\\ncause great delay and general inconvenience, they are not\\nlikely to be at all dangerous.

       " 'The story of submarine telegraphy is a wonderful record\\nof dogged perseverance in the face of tremendous obstacles\\nand disastrous failures. It would be of no interest to trace\\nthe story to its very beginning, and so we will commence\\nwith the laying of the first cable across the English\\nChannel from Dover to Calais, in 1850. A single copper\\nwire covered with a layer of gutta-percha half an inch thick\\nwas used, and leaden weights were attached to it at intervals\\nof one hundred yards, the fixing of each weight necessitating\\nthe stoppage of the cable-laying ship. The line was laid\\nsuccessfully, but it failed after working for a single day, and\\nit afterwards turned out that a Boulogne fisherman had\\nhauled up the cable with his trawl. This line proved that\\ntelegraphic communication between England and France\\nwas possible, but the enterprise was assailed with every\\nimaginable kind of abuse and ridicule. It is said that some\\npeople really believed that the cable was worked in the\\nstyle of the old-fashioned house bell, and that the signals\\nwere given by pulling the wire! In the next year another\\nattempt was made by Mr. T.\\xa0R. Crampton, a prominent\\nrailway engineer, who himself contributed half of the\\n£15,000 required. The form of cable adopted by him\\nconsisted of four copper wires, each covered with two layers\\nof gutta-percha, and the four enclosed in a covering formed\\nof ten galvanized iron wires wound spirally round them.145\\nThe line proved a permanent success, and this type of\\ncable, with certain modifications, is still in use. In 1852\\nthree attempts were made to connect England and Ireland,\\nbut the first two failed owing to the employment of cables\\ntoo light to withstand the strong tidal currents, and the\\nthird was somehow mismanaged as regards the paying-out,\\nso that there was not enough cable to reach across. A\\nheavier cable was tried in the next year, and this was a\\nlasting success.',\n",

As before, the\\ncables were spliced in mid-ocean, and this time, after many\\nanxious days, many false alarms, and one or two narrow\\nescapes from disaster through faulty pieces of cable discovered\\nalmost too late, the cable was landed successfully\\non both shores of the Atlantic early in August.',\n",
       " 'The Atlantic cable was now an accomplished fact, and\\ndismal forebodings were turned into expressions of extravagant\\njoy. The first messages passed between Queen\\nVictoria and the President of the United States, and\\namongst the more important communications was one\\nwhich prevented the sailing from Canada of two British\\nregiments which had been ordered to India during the\\nMutiny. In the meantime the Indian Mutiny had been\\nsuppressed, and therefore these regiments were not required.\\nThe dispatch of this message saved a sum of about\\n£50,000. The prospects of the cable company seemed\\nbright, but after a short time the signals began to grow\\nweaker and weaker, and finally, after about seven hundred\\nmessages had been transmitted, the cable failed altogether.\\nThis was a great blow to the general public, and we can\\nimagine the bitter disappointment of the engineers and\\nelectricians who had laboured so hard and so long to bring148\\nthe cable into being. It was a favourable opportunity for\\nthe croakers, and amongst a certain section of the public\\ndoubts were expressed as to whether any messages had\\nbeen transmitted at all.',\n",
       " 'A great consultation of experts took place with the\\nobject of determining the cause of the failure, and the\\nunanimous opinion was that the cable had been injured by\\nthe use of currents of too great intensity. Some years\\nelapsed before another attempt could be made, but the\\nidea was never abandoned, and a great deal of study was\\ngiven to the problems involved. Mr. Field, the most\\nenergetic of the original projectors, never relaxed his determination\\nthat the cable should be made a success, and he\\nworked incessantly to achieve his ambition. It is said\\nthat in pursuance of his object he made sixty-four crossings\\nof the Atlantic, and considering that he suffered greatly\\nfrom sea-sickness every time this shows remarkable pluck\\nand endurance.',\n",
       " 'In 1865, new capital having been raised, preparations\\nwere made for another expedition. It was now decided\\nto use only one vessel for laying the cable, and the Great\\nEastern was chosen for the task. This vessel had been\\nlying idle for close on ten years, owing to her failure as a\\ncargo boat, but her great size and capacity made her most\\nsuitable for carrying the enormous weight of the whole\\ncable. In July 1865 the Great Eastern set sail, under\\nthe escort of two British warships. When 84 miles had\\nbeen paid out, a fault occurred, and after drawing up about\\n10½ miles it was found that a piece of iron wire had pierced\\nthe coating of the cable. The trouble was put right, and\\nthe paying-out continued successfully until over 700 miles\\nhad been laid, when another fault appeared. The cable\\nwas again drawn in until the fault was reached, and\\nanother piece of iron was found piercing clean through.149\\nIt was evident that two such pieces of iron could not have\\ngot there by accident, and there was no doubt that they\\nhad been inserted intentionally by some malicious scoundrel,\\nmost likely with the object of affecting the company’s\\nshares. A start was made once more, and all went well\\nuntil about two-thirds of the distance had been covered,\\nwhen the cable broke and had to be abandoned after\\nseveral nearly successful attempts to recover it.',\n",
       " 'In spite of the loss, which amounted to £600,000, the\\nenergetic promoters contrived to raise fresh capital, and in\\n1866 the Great Eastern started again. This effort was\\ncompletely successful, and on 28th July 1866 the cable\\nwas landed amidst great rejoicing. The following extracts\\nfrom the diary of the engineer Sir Daniell Gooch, give us\\nsome idea of the landing.',\n",
       " '“Is it wrong that I should have felt as though my\\nheart would burst when that end of our long line touched\\nthe shore amid the booming of cannon, the wild, half-mad\\ncheers and shouts of the men?... I am given a never-dying\\nthought; that I aided in laying the Atlantic cable....\\nThe old cable hands seemed as though they could\\neat the end; one man actually put it into his mouth and\\nsucked it. They held it up and danced round it, cheering\\nat the top of their voices. It was a strange sight, nay, a\\nsight that filled our eyes with tears.... I did cheer, but\\nI could better have silently cried.”',\n",
       " 'This time the cable was destined to have a long and\\nuseful life, and later in the same year the 1865 cable was\\nrecovered, spliced to a new length, and safely brought to\\nland, so that there were now two links between the Old\\nWorld and the New. It was estimated that the total cost\\nof completing the great undertaking, including the cost of\\nthe unsuccessful attempts, was nearly two and a half millions\\nsterling. Since 1866 cable-laying has proceeded very150\\nrapidly, and to-day telegraphic communication exists between\\nalmost all parts of the civilized world. According\\nto recent statistics, the North Atlantic Ocean is now\\ncrossed by no less than 17 cables, the number of cables\\nall over the world being 2937, with a total length of\\n291,137 nautical miles.',\n",
       " 'Before describing the actual working of a submarine\\ncable, a few words on cable-laying may be of interest.\\nBefore the cable-ship starts, another vessel is sent over\\nthe proposed course to make soundings. Galvanized steel\\npianoforte wire is used for sounding, and it is wound in\\nlengths of 3 or 4 nautical miles on gun-metal drums.\\nThe drums are worked by an engine, and the average\\nspeed of working is somewhere about 100 fathoms a\\nminute in descending, and 70 fathoms a minute in picking\\nup. Some idea of the time occupied may be gained from\\na sounding in the Atlantic Ocean which registered a depth\\nof 3233 fathoms, or nearly 3½ miles. The sinker took\\nthirty-three minutes fifty seconds in descending, and forty-five\\nminutes were taken in picking up. The heavy sinker\\nis not brought up with the line, but is detached from the\\nsounder by an ingenious contrivance and left at the bottom.\\nThe sounder is fitted with an arrangement to bring up a\\nspecimen of the bottom, and also a sample of water; and\\nthe temperature at any depth is ascertained by self-registering\\nthermometers.',\n",
       " 'When the soundings are complete the cable-ship takes\\nup her task. The cable is coiled in tanks on board, and\\nis kept constantly under water to prevent injury to the\\ngutta-percha insulation by overheating. As each section\\nis placed in the tank, the ends of it are led to a test-box,\\nand labelled so that they can be easily recognized. Insulated\\nwires run from the test-box to instruments in the\\ntesting-room, so that the electrical condition of the whole151\\ncable is constantly under observation. During the whole\\ntime the cable is being laid its insulation is tested continuously,\\nand at intervals of five minutes signals are sent from\\nthe shore end to the ship, so that a fault is instantly detected.\\nThe cable in its tank is eased out by a number of\\nmen, and mechanics are posted at the cable drums and\\nbrakes, while constant streams of water cool the cable and\\nthe bearings and surfaces of the brakes. The tension, as\\nshown by the dynamometer, is at all times under careful\\nobservation. When it becomes necessary to wind back the\\ncable on account of some fault, cuts are made at intervals\\nof a quarter or half a mile, tests being made at each cutting\\nuntil the fault is localized in-board. As soon as the cable\\nout-board is found “O.K.,” the ends are spliced up and the\\npaying-out begins again. If the cable breaks from any\\ncause, a mark-buoy is lowered instantly on the spot, and\\nthe cable is grappled for. This may take a day or two in\\ngood weather, but a delay of weeks may be caused by bad\\nweather, which makes grappling impossible.',\n",
       " 'The practical working of a submarine cable differs in\\nmany respects from that of a land telegraph line. The\\ncurrents used in submarine telegraphy are extremely small,\\ncontrary to the popular impression. An insulated cable\\nacts like a Leyden jar, in the sense that it accumulates\\nelectricity and does not quickly part with it, as does a bare\\noverhead wire. In the case of a very long cable, such as\\none across the Atlantic, a current continues to flow from it\\nfor some time after the battery is disconnected. A second\\nsignal cannot be sent until the electricity is dissipated and\\nthe cable clear, and if a powerful current were employed\\nthe time occupied in this clearing would be considerable, so\\nthat the speed of signalling would be slow. Another\\nobjection to a powerful current is that if any flaw\\nexists in the insulation of the cable, such a current is apt152\\nto increase the flaw, and finally cause the breakdown of\\nthe line.',\n",
       " 'The feebleness of the currents in submarine telegraphy\\nmakes it impossible to use the ordinary land telegraph\\nreceiver, and a more sensitive instrument known as the\\n“mirror receiver” is used. This consists of a coil of very\\nfine wire, in the centre of which a tiny magnetic needle is\\nsuspended by a fibre of unspun silk. A magnet placed close\\nby keeps the needle in one position when no current is\\nflowing. As the deflections of the needle are extremely\\nsmall, it is necessary to magnify them in some way, and\\nthis is done by fixing to the needle a very small mirror,\\nupon which falls a ray of light from a lamp. The mirror\\nreflects this ray on to a sheet of white paper marked with\\na scale, and as the mirror moves along with the needle the\\npoint of light travels over the paper, a very small movement\\nof the needle causing the light to travel some inches.\\nThe receiving operator sits in a darkened room and\\nwatches the light, which moves to the right or to the left\\naccording to the direction of the current. The signals\\nemployed are the same as those for the single-needle\\ninstrument, a movement to the left indicating a dot, and\\none to the right a dash. In many instruments the total\\nweight of magnet and mirror is only two or three grains,\\nand the sensitiveness is such that the current from a voltaic\\ncell consisting of a lady’s silver thimble with a few drops of\\nacidulated water and a diminutive rod of zinc, is sufficient\\nto transmit a message across the Atlantic.',\n",
       " 'The mirror receiver cannot write down its messages,\\nand for recording purposes an instrument invented by Lord\\nKelvin, and called the “siphon recorder,” is used. In this\\ninstrument a coil of wire is suspended between the poles of\\nan electro-magnet, and to it is connected by means of a silk\\nfibre a delicate glass tube or siphon. One end of the153\\nsiphon dips into an ink-well, and capillary attraction causes\\nthe ink to fill the siphon. The other end of the siphon\\nalmost touches a moving paper ribbon placed beneath it.\\nThe ink and the paper are oppositely electrified, and the\\nattraction between the opposite charges causes the ink to\\nspurt out of the siphon in very minute drops, which fall on\\nto the paper. As long as no current is passing the siphon\\nremains stationary, but when a current flows from the cable\\nthrough the coil, the latter moves to one side or the other,\\naccording to the direction of the current, and makes the\\nsiphon move also. Consequently, instead of a straight line\\nalong the middle of the paper ribbon, a wavy line with\\nlittle peaks on each side of the centre is produced by the\\nminute drops of ink. This recorder sometimes refuses to\\nwork properly in damp weather, owing to the loss of the\\nopposite charges on ink and paper, but a later inventor,\\nnamed Cuttriss, has removed this trouble by using a siphon\\nkept constantly in vibration by electro-magnetism. The\\nordinary single-needle code is used for the siphon recorder.',\n",
       " 'In our younger days most of us have amused ourselves\\nwith a toy telephone consisting of a long piece of string\\nhaving each end passed through the bottom of a little cardboard\\nbox, and secured by a knot. If the string is stretched\\ntightly this arrangement enables whispered words to be\\nheard at a distance of 20 or 30 yards. Simple as is\\nthis little toy, yet it is probable that many people would\\nbe rather nonplussed if asked suddenly to explain how the\\nsounds travel along the string from one box to the other.\\nIf the toy had some complicated mechanism most likely\\nevery one would want to know how it worked, but the whole\\nthing is so extremely simple that generally it is dismissed\\nwithout a thought.',\n",
       " 'If we strike a tuning-fork and then hold it close to the\\near, we hear that it produces a sound, and at the same time,\\nfrom a slight sensation in the hand, we become aware that\\nthe fork is in vibration. As the fork vibrates it disturbs\\nthe tiny particles of air round it and sets them vibrating,\\nand these vibrations are communicated from one particle to\\nanother until they reach the drum of the ear, when that also\\nbegins to vibrate and we hear a sound. This is only\\nanother way of saying that the disturbances of the air\\ncaused by the vibrations of the tuning-fork are propagated\\nin a series of waves, which we call “sound waves.” Sound is\\ntransmitted better through liquids than through the air, and155\\nbetter still through solids, and this is why words spoken so\\nsoftly as to be inaudible through the air at a distance of,\\nsay, 100 feet, can be heard fairly distinctly at that distance\\nby means of the string telephone. The sound reaches us\\nalong the string in exactly the same way as through the air,\\nthat is, by means of minute impulses passed on from particle\\nto particle.',\n",
       " 'A more satisfactory arrangement than the string telephone\\nconsists of two thin plates of metal connected by a\\nwire which is stretched very tightly. Words spoken close\\nto one plate are heard by a listener at the other plate up to\\na considerable distance. Let us try to see exactly what\\ntakes place when this apparatus is used. In the act of\\nspeaking, vibrations are set up in the air, and these in turn\\nset up vibrations in the metal plate. The vibrations are\\nthen communicated to the wire and to the metal plate at\\nthe other end, and finally the vibrations of this plate produce\\nvibrations in the air between the plate and the listener,\\nand the sound reaches the ear.',\n",
       " 'This simple experiment shows the remarkable fact that\\na plate of metal is able to reproduce faithfully all the vibrations\\ncommunicated to it by the human voice, and from this\\nfact it follows that if we can communicate the vibrations set\\nup in one plate by the voice, to another plate at a distance\\nof 100 miles, we shall be able to speak to a listener\\nat the further plate just as if he were close to us. A\\nstretched string or wire transmits the vibrations fairly well\\nup to a certain distance, but beyond this distance the vibrations\\nbecome weaker and weaker until no sound at all\\nreaches the air. By the aid of electricity, however, we can\\ntransmit the vibrations to a tremendous distance, the range\\nbeing limited only by the imperfections of our apparatus.',\n",
       " 'The first attempt at the construction of an electric\\ntelephone, that is an instrument by means of which the156\\nvibrations set up by the voice or by a musical instrument\\nare transmitted by electricity, was made in 1860 by Johann\\nPhilipp Reis, a teacher in a school at Friedrichsdorf, in\\nGermany. His transmitting apparatus consisted of a box\\nhaving a hole covered by a tightly stretched membrane, to\\nwhich was attached a little strip of platinum. When the\\nmembrane was made to vibrate by sounds produced close\\nto the box, the strip of platinum moved to and fro against\\na metal tip, which closed the circuit of a battery. The\\nreceiver was a long needle of soft iron round which was\\nwound a coil of wire, and the ends of the needle rested on\\ntwo little bridges of a sounding box. The vibrations of\\nthe membrane opened and closed the circuit at a great\\nspeed, and the rapid magnetization of the needle produced\\na tone of the same pitch as the one which set the membrane\\nvibrating. This apparatus transmitted musical sounds and\\nmelodies with great accuracy, but there is considerable\\ndifference of opinion as to whether it was able to transmit\\nspeech. Professor Sylvanus Thompson distinctly states\\nthat Reis’s telephone could and did transmit speech, but\\nother experts dispute the fact. We probably shall be quite\\nsafe in concluding that this telephone did transmit speech,\\nbut very imperfectly. In any case it is certain that the\\nreceiver of this apparatus is not based on the same principle\\nas the modern telephone receiver.',\n",
       " 'Some years later Graham Bell, Professor of Vocal\\nPhysiology in the University of Boston, turned his attention\\nto the electric transmission of speech, probably being led to\\ndo so from his experiments in teaching the deaf and dumb.\\nHis apparatuses shown at an exhibition in Philadelphia in\\n1876, consisted of a tube having one end open for speaking\\ninto, and the other closed by a tightly stretched membrane\\nto which was attached a very light steel bar magnet. The\\nvibrations set up in the membrane by the voice made the157\\nlittle magnet move to and fro in front of the poles of an\\nelectro-magnet, inserted in a battery circuit, thus inducing\\ncurrents of electricity in the coils of the latter magnet.\\nThe currents produced in this way varied in direction and\\nstrength according to the vibratory movements of the\\nmembrane, and being transmitted along a wire they\\nproduced similar variations in current in another electro-magnet\\nin the receiver. The currents produced in this\\nmanner in the receiver set up vibrations in a metal\\ndiaphragm in front of the magnet poles, and so the words\\nspoken into the transmitter were reproduced.',\n",
       " 'Since the year 1876 the telephone has developed with\\nremarkable rapidity, and an attempt to trace its growth\\nwould involve a series of detailed descriptions of closely\\nsimilar inventions which would be quite uninteresting to\\nmost readers. Now, therefore, that we have introduced\\nthe instruments, and seen something of its principle and\\nits early forms, it will be most satisfactory to omit the\\nintermediate stages and to go on to the telephone as used\\nin recent years. The first telephone to come into general\\nuse was the invention of Graham Bell, and was an improved\\nform of his early instrument just described. A case or\\ntube of ebonite, which forms the handle of the instrument,\\ncontains a steel bar magnet having a small coil of insulated\\nwire at the end nearest the mouthpiece of the tube, the\\nends of the coil passing along the tube to be connected to\\nthe line wires. Close to the coil end of the magnet, and\\nbetween it and the mouthpiece, is fixed a diaphragm of\\nthin sheet-iron. A complete outfit consists of two of these\\ninstruments connected by wires, and it will be noticed that\\nno battery is employed.',\n",
       " 'The air vibrations set up by the voice make the\\ndiaphragm vibrate also, so that it moves backwards and\\nforwards. These movements are infinitesimally small, but158\\nthey are sufficient to affect the lines of force of the magnet\\nto such an extent that rapidly alternating currents of varying\\ndegrees of strength are set up in the coil and sent along\\nthe line wire. On arriving at the receiver these currents\\npass through the coil and produce rapid variations in the\\nstrength of the magnet, so that instead of exerting a\\nuniform attraction upon the iron diaphragm, the magnet\\npulls it with constantly varying force, and thus sets it\\nvibrating. The air in front of the diaphragm now begins\\nto vibrate, and the listener hears a reproduction of the\\nwords spoken into the transmitter. The way in which the\\nfluctuations of the current make the second diaphragm\\nvibrate exactly in accordance with the first is very remarkable,\\nand it is important to notice that the listener does not\\nhear the actual voice of the speaker, but a perfect reproduction\\nof it; in fact, the second diaphragm speaks.',\n",
       " 'The reader probably will be surprised to be told that\\nthe transmitter and the receiver of a magneto-electric\\ntelephone are respectively a dynamo and electric motor of\\nminute proportions. We provide a dynamo with mechanical\\nmotion and it gives us electric current, and by sending\\nthis current through an electric motor we get mechanical\\nmotion back again. In the transmitter of the telephone\\njust described, the mechanical motion is in the form of\\nvibrations of the metal diaphragm, which set up currents of\\nelectricity in the coil of wire round the magnet, so that the\\ntransmitter is really a tiny dynamo driven by the voice.\\nThe receiver is provided with electric current from the\\ntransmitter, and it converts this into mechanical motion in\\nthe diaphragm, so that the receiver is a little electric motor.',\n",
       " 'Transmitters of the type just described work well over\\nshort distances, but the currents they produce are too feeble\\nfor transmission over a very long wire, and on this account\\nthey have been superseded by transmitters on the microphone159\\nprinciple. A microphone is an instrument for\\nmaking extremely small sounds plainly audible. If a\\ncurrent is passed through a box containing loose bits of\\nbroken carbon, it meets with great resistance, but if the\\nbits of carbon are compressed their conducting power is\\nconsiderably increased. Even such slight differences in\\npressure as are produced by vibrating the box will affect\\nthe amount of current passing through the carbon. If this\\ncurrent is led by wires to an ordinary telephone receiver\\nthe arrangement becomes a simple form of microphone.\\nThe vibrations of the box vary\\nthe resistance of the carbon,\\nand the corresponding variations\\nin the current set up\\nvibrations in the receiver, but\\nin a magnified form. The\\nsmallest sound vibrations alter\\nthe resistance of the carbon,\\nand as these vibrations are\\nmagnified in the receiver, the\\nreproduced sound is magnified\\nalso. The footsteps of a fly\\nmay be heard quite distinctly by means of a good microphone,\\nand the ticks of a watch sound like the strokes of a\\nhammer.',\n",
       " 'By means of this power of magnifying vibrations a\\nmicrophone transmitter can be used on a line of tremendous\\nlength, where an ordinary Bell transmitter would be utterly\\nuseless. The general features of this transmitter, Fig. 31,\\nare a diaphragm and a block of carbon separated slightly\\nfrom one another, the intervening space being filled with\\ngranules of carbon. These are enclosed in a case of\\nebonite having a mouthpiece in front and two terminals\\nbehind, one terminal being connected with the carbon block160\\nand the other with the diaphragm. From these terminals\\nwires are led to a battery and to the receiver, which is of\\nthe Bell type. The current has to pass through the carbon\\ngranules, and the movements of the diaphragm when set in\\nvibration by the voice vary the pressure upon the granules,\\nand in this way set up variations in the current. Carbon\\ndust also may be used instead of granular carbon, and then the\\ninstrument is called a “dust transmitter.”',\n",
       " 'It is usual to have a transmitter and\\na receiver on one handle for the greater\\nconvenience of the user. The arrangement\\nis shown in Fig. 32, and it will be\\nseen that when the user places the receiver\\nto his ear the transmitting mouthpiece is\\nin position for speaking. The microphone\\nwith its carbon dust is placed at A, just\\nbelow the mouthpiece, and the earpiece\\nor receiver B contains a little magnet and\\ncoil with a diaphragm in front, so that it\\nis really a Bell instrument. A little lever\\nwill be noticed at C. This is a switch\\nwhich brings the transmitter into circuit\\non being pressed with the finger.',\n",
       " 'It is now time to see something of the\\narrangement and working of telephone\\nsystems. As soon as the telephone became a commercially\\npracticable instrument the necessity for some means of\\ninter-communication became evident, and the telephone\\nexchange was brought into being. The first exchange\\nwas started in 1877, in Boston, but this was a very\\nsmall affair and it was run on very crude lines. When\\none subscriber wished to communicate with another he\\nhad to call up an operator, who received the message\\nand repeated it to the person for whom it was intended;161\\nthere was no direct communication between the various\\nsubscribers’ instruments. As the number of users increased\\nit became necessary to devise some system\\nwhereby each subscriber could call the attention of an\\noperator at the central station, and be put into direct\\ncommunication with any other subscriber without delay;\\nand the exchange system of to-day, which fulfils these\\nrequirements almost to perfection, is the result of gradual\\nimprovements in telephone methods extending over some\\nthirty-five years.',\n",
       " 'When a subscriber wishes to telephone, he first must\\ncall up the operator at the exchange. Until comparatively\\nrecently this was done by turning a handle placed at the\\nside of the instrument. This handle operated a little\\ndynamo, and the current produced caused a shutter at the\\nexchange to drop and reveal a number, just as in the\\nelectric bell indicator, so that the operator knew which\\ninstrument was calling. As soon as the operator answered\\nthe call, the shutter replaced itself automatically. The\\nsignal to disconnect was given in the same way, but the\\nindicator was of a different colour in order to prevent confusion\\nwith a call signal. These handle-operated telephones\\nare still in common use, but they are being replaced by\\ninstruments which do away with handle-turning on the\\npart of the subscriber, and with dropping shutters at the\\nexchange. In this latest system all that the subscriber has\\nto do is to lift his telephone from its rest, when a little\\nelectric lamp lights up at the exchange; and when he has\\nfinished his conversation he merely replaces the telephone,\\nand again a little lamp glows.',\n",
       " 'We must now see what happens at the exchange when\\na call is made. Each operator has control of a number of\\npairs of flexible cords terminating in plugs, the two cords\\nof each pair being electrically connected. The plugs rest162\\non a shelf in front of the operator, and the cords pass\\nthrough the shelf and hang down below it. If a plug is\\nlifted, the cord comes up through the shelf, and it is drawn\\nback again by a weight when the plug is not in use. Two\\nlamps are provided for each pair of cords, one being fixed\\nclose to each cord. The two wires leading from each\\nsubscriber’s instrument are connected to a little tube-shaped\\nswitch called a “jack,” and each jack has a lamp of its own.\\nWhen a subscriber lifts his telephone from its rest a lamp\\nglows, and the operator inserts one plug of a pair into the\\njack thus indicated, and the lamp goes out automatically.\\nShe then switches on her telephone to the caller and asks\\nfor the number of the subscriber to whom he wishes to\\nspeak; and as soon as she gets this she inserts the other\\nplug of the pair into the jack belonging to this number.\\nBy a simple movement she then rings up the required\\nperson by switching on the current to his telephone bell.',\n",
       " 'Here comes in the use of the two lamps connected with\\nthe cords. As long as the subscribers’ telephones are on\\ntheir rests the lamps are lighted, but as soon as they are\\nlifted off the lamps go out. The caller’s telephone is of\\ncourse off its rest, and so the lamp connected with the first\\ncord is not lit; but until the subscriber rung up lifts his\\ninstrument to answer the call, the lamp of the second cord\\nremains lit, having first lighted up when the plug was\\ninserted in the jack of his number. When the second\\nlamp goes out the operator knows that the call has been\\nresponded to, and that the two subscribers are in communication\\nwith each other. Having finished their conversation,\\nboth subscribers replace their instruments on the\\nrests, whereupon both lamps light up, informing the operator\\nthat she may disconnect by pulling out the plugs.',\n",
       " 'It is manifestly impossible for one operator to attend\\nto the calls of all the subscribers in the exchange, and so a163\\nnumber of operators are employed, each one having to\\nattend to the calls of a certain number of subscribers. At\\nthe same time it is clear that each operator may be called\\nupon to connect one of her subscribers to any other subscriber\\nin the whole exchange. In order to make this\\npossible the switchboard is divided into sections, each\\nhaving as many jacks as there are lines in the exchange, so\\nthat in this respect all the sections are multiples of each\\nother, and the whole arrangement is called a “multiple\\nswitchboard,” the repeated jacks being called “multiple\\njacks.” Then there are other jacks which it is not necessary\\nto duplicate. We have seen that when a subscriber calls the\\nexchange a lamp glows, and the operator inserts a plug into\\nthe jack beside the lamp, in order to answer the call and\\nascertain what number is required. These are called\\n“answering jacks,” and the lamp is the line signal. It is\\nusual to have three operators to each section of the switchboard,\\nand each operator has charge of so many answering\\njacks, representing so many subscribers. At the same\\ntime she has access to the whole section, so that she can\\nconnect any of her subscribers to any other line in the\\nexchange.',\n",
       " 'When a number is called for, the operator must be able\\nto tell at once whether the line is free or not. The jack\\nin her section may be unoccupied, but she must know also\\nwhether all the multiple jacks belonging to that number\\nare free, for an operator at another section may have\\nconnected the line to one of her subscribers. To enable\\nan operator to ascertain this quickly an electrical test is\\nprovided. When two lines are connected, the whole of the\\nmultiple jacks belonging to each are charged with electricity,\\nand if an operator at any section touches one of these jacks\\nwith a plug, a current through her receiver makes a click,\\nand on hearing the click she knows that the line is engaged.164\\nThe testing takes an extremely short time, and this is why a\\ncaller receives the reply, “Number engaged,” so promptly\\nthat he feels inclined to doubt whether the operator has\\nmade any attempt at all to connect him up to the number.',\n",
       " 'In order that an operator may have both hands free to\\nmanipulate the plugs, her telephone receiver is fixed over\\none ear by a fastening passing over her head, and the\\ntransmitter is hung from her shoulders so as to be close to\\nher mouth.',\n",
       " 'In telegraphy it is the rule to employ the earth for the\\nreturn part of the circuit, but this is not customary in\\ntelephony. The telephone is a much more sensitive\\ninstrument than the telegraph, and a telephone having an\\nearth return is subject to all kinds of strange and weird\\nnoises which greatly interfere with conversation. These\\nnoises may be caused by natural electrical disturbances, or\\nby the proximity of telegraph and other wires conveying\\nelectric currents. On this account telephone lines are\\nmade with a complete metallic circuit. As in telegraphy,\\nprotection from lightning flashes is afforded by lightning\\narresters. The current for the working of a telephone\\nexchange is supplied from a central battery of accumulators,\\nand also from dynamos.',\n",
       " 'Although the manual exchange telephone system of\\nto-day works with remarkable efficiency, it has certain\\nweak points. For instance, if an operator cares to do so,\\nshe can listen to conversations between subscribers, so\\nthat privacy cannot be assured. As a matter of fact, the\\noperators have little time for this kind of thing, at any rate\\nduring the busy hours of the day, and as a rule they are\\nnot sufficiently interested in other people’s affairs to make\\nany attempt to listen to their remarks. The male operators\\nwho work through the slack hours of the night are\\noccasionally guilty of listening. Some time ago the writer\\nhad to ring up a friend in the very early morning, and\\nduring the conversation this gentleman asked what time it\\nwas. Before the writer had time to get a word out, a deep\\nbass voice from the exchange replied, “Half-past two.”\\nLittle incidents of this sort remind one that it is not wise\\nto speak too freely by telephone. Then again operators are\\nliable to make wrong connexions through faulty hearing\\nof the number called for, and these are equally annoying to\\nthe caller and to the person rung up in mistake. Many\\nother defects might be mentioned, but these are sufficient\\nto show that the manual system is not perfect.',\n",
       " 'For a long time inventors have been striving to do\\naway with all such defects by abolishing the exchange\\noperators, and substituting mechanism to work the\\nexchanges automatically, and during the last few years the\\nsystem of the Automatic Electric Company, of Chicago,\\nhas been brought to great perfection. This system is in\\nextensive use in the United States, and is employed in\\ntwo or three exchanges in this country. Unfortunately\\nthe mechanism of this system is extremely complicated, so\\nthat it is impossible to describe it fully in a book of this\\nkind; but some idea of the method of working may be\\ngiven without entering into technical details.',\n",
       " 'Each subscriber’s telephone instrument is fitted with a\\ndial which turns round on a pivot at its centre. This dial\\nhas a series of holes round its circumference, numbered\\nconsecutively from 1 to 9, and 0. Suppose now a\\nsubscriber wishes to speak to a friend whose telephone\\nnumber is 2583. He removes the receiver from its hook,\\nplaces his finger in the hole marked 2, and turns the dial\\nround in a clockwise direction until his finger comes in\\ncontact with a stop. He then removes his finger, and the\\ndial automatically returns to its original position. He then\\nplaces his finger in the hole marked 5, and again turns the166\\ndial as far as the stop, and when the dial has returned to\\nthe normal position he repeats the process with his finger\\nplaced successively in the holes marked 8 and 3. He now\\nplaces the receiver to his ear, and by the time he has done\\nthis the automatic mechanism at the exchange has made\\nthe necessary connexions, and has rung the bell of\\nsubscriber number 2583. On completing the conversation\\neach subscriber returns his receiver to its hook, and the\\nexchange mechanism returns to its normal position.',\n",
       " 'The turning of the dial by the finger coils up a spring,\\nand this spring, acting along with a speed governor, makes\\nthe dial return to its first position at a certain definite\\nspeed as soon as the finger is removed. During this\\nretrograde movement a switch automatically sends out into\\nthe line a certain number of impulses, the number being\\ndetermined by the hole in which the finger is placed. In\\nthe case supposed, groups of two, five, eight, and three\\nimpulses respectively would be sent out, each group\\nseparated from the next by an interval during which the\\nsubscriber is turning the dial.',\n",
       " 'Now let us see what takes place at the exchange.\\nThe subscriber’s instrument is connected to a mechanical\\narrangement known as a “line switch.” This switch\\nis brought into play by the act of removing the receiver\\nfrom its hook, and it then automatically connects the\\nsubscriber’s line to what is called a “first selector” switch.\\nThe group of two impulses sent out by the first turning of\\nthe dial raises this first selector two steps, and it then\\nsweeps along a row of contacts connected to “trunks”\\ngoing to the 2000 section. Passing by occupied trunks, it\\nfinds an idle one, and so connects the line to an idle\\n“second selector.” This selector is operated by the second\\ngroup of impulses, five in number, and after being raised\\nfive steps it acts like the first selector, and finds an idle167\\ntrunk leading to the 2500 section. This places the caller’s\\nline in connexion with still another switch called a\\n“connector,” and this switch, operated by the remaining\\ngroups of eight and three impulses, finds the required tens\\nsection, and selects the third member of that section. If\\nthe number 2583 is disengaged, the connector switch now\\nsends current from the central battery to this instrument,\\nthus ringing its bell, and it also supplies speaking current\\nto the two lines during the conversation, restores the\\nexchange mechanism to its original condition as soon as\\nthe conversation is ended and the subscribers have hung\\nup their receivers, and registers the call on the calling\\nsubscriber’s meter. If the connector finds the number\\nengaged, it sends out an intermittent buzzing sound, to\\ninform the caller of the fact. All these operations take\\ntime to describe, even in outline, but in practice they are\\ncarried out with the utmost rapidity, each step in the connecting-up\\nprocess taking only a small fraction of a second.',\n",
       " 'For ordinary local calls the automatic system requires\\nno operators at all, but for the convenience of users there\\nare usually two clerks at the exchange, one to give\\nany information required by subscribers, and the other to\\nrecord complaints regarding faulty working. For trunk\\ncalls, the subscriber places his finger in the hole marked 0,\\nand gives the dial one turn. This connects him to an\\noperator at the trunk switchboard, who makes the required\\nconnexion and then calls him up in the usual way.',\n",
       " 'It might be thought that the complex mechanism of an\\nautomatic exchange would constantly be getting out of\\norder, but it is found to work with great smoothness.\\nEach automatic switchboard has a skilled electrician in\\nattendance, and he is informed instantly of any faulty\\nworking by means of supervisory lamps and other signals.\\nEven without these signals the attendant would be quickly168\\naware of any breakdown, for his ear becomes so accustomed\\nto the sounds made by the apparatus during the connecting-up,\\nthat any abnormal sound due to faulty connecting\\nattracts his attention at once. However detected, the\\nfaults are put right immediately, and it often happens that\\na defective line is noted and repaired before the subscriber\\nknows that anything is wrong.',\n",
       " 'On account of its high speed in making connexions\\nand disconnexions, its absolute accuracy, and its privacy,\\nthe automatic telephone system has proved most popular\\nwherever it has been given a fair trial. Its advantages are\\nmost obvious in large city exchanges where the traffic\\nduring business hours is tremendously heavy, and it is\\nprobable that before very long the automatic system will\\nhave replaced manual methods for all such exchanges.',\n",

       " 'By the time that the telephone came to be a really\\npractical instrument, capable of communicating over long\\ndistances on land, the Atlantic telegraph cable was in\\noperation, and an attempt was made to telephone from one\\ncontinent to the other by means of it, but without success.\\nIn speaking of submarine telegraphy in Chapter XVII. we\\nsaw that the cable acts like a Leyden jar, and it was this\\nfact that made it impossible to telephone through more than\\nabout 20 miles of cable, so that transatlantic telephony\\nwas quite out of the question. It was evident that little\\nprogress could be made in this direction unless some means\\ncould be devised for neutralizing this capacity effect, as it170\\nis called, of the cable, and finally it was discovered that\\nthis could be done by inserting at intervals along the cable\\na number of coils of wire. These coils are known as “loading\\ncoils,” and a cable provided with them is called a “loaded\\ncable.” Such cables have been laid across various narrow\\nseas, such as between England and France, and England\\nand Ireland, and these have proved very successful for\\ntelephonic communication. The problem of transatlantic\\ntelephony however still remains to be solved. Experiments\\nhave been made in submarine telephony over a bare\\niron cable, instead of the usual insulated cable. Conversations\\nhave been carried on in this way without difficulty\\nbetween Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., and Vashon\\nIsland, a total distance of about 11 miles, and it is\\npossible that uninsulated cables may play an extremely\\nimportant part in the development of submarine telephony.',\n",
       " 'In telegraphy messages not only may be received, but also\\nrecorded, by the Morse printer or one of its modifications,\\nbut in ordinary telephony there is no mechanical method of\\nrecording messages.

Several arrangements for overcoming\\nthis difficulty by means of automatic recording\\nmechanism have been invented, but the only really successful\\none is the telegraphone.',\n",
       " 'This instrument is the invention of Waldemar Poulsen,\\nwhose apparatus for wireless telegraphy we shall speak of\\nin the next chapter. The telegraphone performs at the\\nsame time the work of a telephone and of a phonograph.\\nIn the ordinary type of phonograph the record is made in\\nthe form of depressions or indentations on the surface of a\\ncylinder of wax; these indentations being produced by a\\nstylus actuated by vibrations set up in a diaphragm by the\\nact of speaking. In the telegraphone the same result is\\nobtained entirely by electro-magnetic action. The wax\\ncylinder of the phonograph is replaced by a steel wire or\\nribbon, and the recording stylus by an electro-magnet.172\\nThe steel ribbon is arranged to travel along over two\\ncylinders or reels kept in constant rotation, and a small\\nelectro-magnet is fixed midway between the cylinders so\\nthat the ribbon passes close above it. This magnet is\\nconnected to the telephone line, so that its magnetism\\nfluctuates in accordance with the variations in the current\\nin the line. We have seen that steel retains magnetism\\nimparted to it. In passing over the electro-magnet the\\nsteel ribbon is magnetized in constantly varying degrees,\\ncorresponding exactly with the variations in the line current\\nset up by the speaker’s voice, and these magnetic impressions\\nare retained by the ribbon. When the speaker has\\nfinished, the telephone line is disconnected, the ribbon is\\ncarried back to the point at which it started, and the\\napparatus is connected to the telephone receiver. The\\nribbon now moves forward again, and this time it acts like\\nthe speaker’s voice, the varying intensity of its magnetic\\nrecord producing corresponding variations in the strength\\nof the magnet, so causing the receiver diaphragm to reproduce\\nthe sounds in the ordinary way.',\n",
       " 'The magnetic record made in this manner is fairly\\npermanent, and if desired it may be reproduced over and\\nover again. In most cases, however, a permanent record\\nis of no value, and so the magnetic impressions are\\nobliterated in order that the ribbon may be used to take\\na new record. This can be done by passing a permanent\\nmagnet along the ribbon, but it is more convenient to have\\nan automatic obliterating arrangement. This consists of\\nanother electro-magnet fixed close to the recording magnet,\\nso that the ribbon passes over it before reaching the latter.\\nThe obliterating magnet is connected with a battery, and\\nits unvarying magnetism destroys all traces of the previous\\nrecord, and the ribbon passes forward to the recording\\nmagnet ready to receive new impressions.',\n",

       " 'For recording telephone messages the telegraphone is\\nattached to the telephone instrument, and by automatically\\noperated switches it is set working by a distant speaker.\\nIt records all messages received during the absence of its\\nowner, who, on his return, connects it to his receiver, and\\nthus hears a faithful reproduction of every word. By\\nspeaking into his instrument before going out, the owner\\ncan leave a message stating the time at which he expects\\nto return, and this message will be repeated by the telegraphone\\nto anybody ringing up in the meantime. The\\nmost recent forms of telegraphone are capable of recording\\nspeeches over an hour in length, and their reproduction is\\nas clear as that of any phonograph, indeed in many respects\\nit is considerably more perfect.',\n",
       " 'Another electrical apparatus for recording speech may\\nbe mentioned. This rejoices in the uncouth name of the\\nPhotographophone, and it is the invention of Ernst\\nRuhmer, a German. Its working is based upon the fact\\nthat the intensity of the light of the electric arc may be\\nvaried by sound vibrations, each variation in the latter\\nproducing a corresponding variation in the amount of light.\\nIn the photographophone the light of an arc lamp is passed\\nthrough a lens which focuses it upon a moving photographic\\nfilm. By speaking or singing, the light is made to vary in\\nbrilliance, and proportionate effects are produced in the\\nsilver bromide of the film. On developing the film a\\npermanent record of the changes in the light intensity is\\nobtained, in the form of shadings of different degrees of\\ndarkness. The film is now moved forward from end to\\nend in front of a fairly powerful lamp. The light passes\\nthrough the film, and falls upon a sort of plate made of\\nselenium. This is a non-metallic substance which possesses\\nthe curious property of altering its resistance to an electric\\ncurrent according to the amount of light falling upon it;174\\nthe greater the amount of light, the more current will the\\nselenium allow to pass. The selenium plate is connected\\nwith a telephone receiver and with a battery. As the film\\ntravels along, its varying shadings allow an ever-changing\\namount of light to pass through and fall upon the selenium,\\nwhich varies its resistance accordingly. The resulting\\nvariations in the current make the receiver diaphragm give\\nout a series of sounds, which are exact reproductions of the\\noriginal sounds made by the voice. The reproduction of\\nspeech by the photographophone is quite good, but as a\\nrule it is not so perfect as with the telegraphone.',\n",
       " 'About ten years ago a German inventor, Professor A.\\nKorn, brought out the first really practical method of\\ntelegraphing drawings or photographs. This invention is\\nremarkable not only for what it accomplishes, but perhaps\\nstill more for the ingenuity with which the many peculiar\\ndifficulties of the process are overcome. Like the photographophone,\\nKorn’s photo-telegraphic apparatus utilizes\\nthe power of selenium to alter its resistance with the amount\\nof light reaching it.',\n",
       " 'Almost everybody is familiar with the terms “positive”\\nand “negative” as used in photography. The finished paper\\nprint is a positive, with light and shade in the correct\\npositions; while the glass plate from which the print is made\\nis a negative, with light and shade reversed. The lantern\\nslide also is a positive, and it is exactly like the paper print,\\nexcept that it has a base of glass instead of paper, so that\\nit is transparent. Similarly, a positive may be made on a\\npiece of celluloid, and this, besides being transparent, is\\nflexible. The first step in transmitting on the Korn system\\nis to make from the photograph to be telegraphed a positive\\nof this kind, both transparent and flexible. This is bent\\nround a glass drum or cylinder, and fixed so that it cannot\\npossibly move. The cylinder is given a twofold movement.175\\nIt is rotated by means of an electric motor, and at\\nthe same time it is made to travel slowly along in the\\ndirection of its length. In fact its movement is very\\nsimilar to that of a screw, which turns round and moves\\nforward at the same time. A powerful beam of light is\\nconcentrated upon the positive. This beam remains\\nstationary, but owing to the dual movement of the cylinder\\nit passes over every part of the positive, following a spiral\\npath. Exactly the same effect would be produced by\\nkeeping the cylinder still and moving the beam spirally\\nround it, but this arrangement would be more difficult to\\nmanipulate. The forward movement of the cylinder is\\nextremely small, so that the spiral is as fine as it is possible\\nto get it without having adjacent lines actually touching.\\nThe light passes through the positive into the cylinder, and\\nis reflected towards a selenium cell; and as the positive\\nhas an almost infinite number of gradations of tone, or\\ndegrees of light and shade, the amount of light reaching\\nthe cell varies constantly all the time. The selenium\\ntherefore alters its resistance, and allows a constantly\\nvarying current to pass through it, and so to the transmission\\nline.',\n",
       " 'At the receiving end is another cylinder having the\\nsame rotating and forward movement, and round this is\\nfixed a sensitive photographic film. This film is protected\\nby a screen having a small opening, and no light can reach\\nit except through this aperture. The incoming current is\\nmade to control a beam of light focused to fall upon the\\nscreen aperture, the amount of light varying according to\\nthe amount of current. In this way the beam of light, like\\nthe one at the transmitting end, traces a spiral from end to\\nend of the film, and on developing the film a reproduction\\nof the original photograph is obtained. The telegraphed\\nphotograph is thus made up of an enormous number176\\nof lines side by side, but these are so close to one\\nanother that they are scarcely noticed, and the effect is\\nsomething like that of a rather coarse-grained ordinary\\nphotograph.',\n",
       " 'It is obvious that the success of this method depends\\nupon the maintaining of absolute uniformity in the motion\\nof the two cylinders, and this is managed in a very ingenious\\nway. It will be remembered that one method of securing\\nuniformity in a number of sub-clocks under the control of\\na master-clock is that of adjusting the sub-clocks to go a\\nlittle faster than the master-clock. Then, when the sub-clocks\\nreach the hour, they are held back by electro-magnetic\\naction until the master-clock arrives at the hour,\\nwhen all proceed together.',\n",
       " 'A similar method is employed for the cylinders. They\\nare driven by electric motors, and the motor at the receiving\\nend is adjusted so as to run very slightly faster\\nthan the motor at the sending end. The result is that\\nthe receiving cylinder completes one revolution a minute\\nfraction of a second before the transmitting cylinder. It\\nis then automatically held back until the sending cylinder\\ncompletes its revolution, and then both commence the next\\nrevolution exactly together. The pause made by the\\nreceiving cylinder is of extremely short duration, but in\\norder that there shall be no break in the spiral traced by\\nlight upon the film, the pause takes place at the point\\nwhere the ends of the film come together. In actual\\npractice certain other details of adjustment are required\\nto ensure precision in working, but the main features of\\nthe process are as described.',\n",
       " 'Although the above photo-telegraphic process is very\\nsatisfactory in working, it has been superseded to some\\nextent by another process of a quite different nature. By\\ncopying the original photograph through a glass screen177\\ncovered with a multitude of very fine parallel lines, a half-tone\\nreproduction is made. This is formed of an immense\\nnumber of light and dark lines of varying breadth, and it\\nis printed in non-conducting ink on lead-foil, so that while\\nthe dark lines are bare foil, the light ones are covered with\\nthe ink. This half-tone is placed round a metal cylinder\\nhaving the same movement as the cylinders in the previous\\nprocesses, and a metal point, or “stylus” as it is called, is\\nmade to rest lightly upon the foil picture, so that it travels\\nall over it, from one end to the other. An electrical circuit\\nis arranged so that when the stylus touches a piece of the\\nbare foil a current is sent out along the line wire. This\\ncurrent is therefore intermittent, being interrupted each\\ntime the stylus passes over a part of the half-tone picture\\ncovered with the non-conducting ink, the succeeding\\nperiods of current and no current varying with the breadth\\nof the conducting and the non-conducting lines. This\\nintermittent current goes to a similar arrangement of\\nstylus and cylinder at the receiving end, this cylinder\\nhaving round it a sheet of paper coated with a chemical\\npreparation. The coating is white all over to begin with,\\nbut it turns black wherever the current passes through it.\\nThe final result is that the intermittent current builds up\\na reproduction in black-and-white of the original photograph.\\nIn this process also the cylinders have to be\\n“synchronized,” or adjusted to run at the same speed.\\nBoth this process and the foregoing one have been used\\nsuccessfully for the transmission of press photographs,\\nnotably by the Daily Mirror.',\n",
       " 'Professor Korn has carried out some interesting and\\nfairly successful experiments in wireless transmission of\\nphotographs, but as yet the wireless results are considerably\\ninferior to those obtained with a line conductor. For\\ntransmitting black-and-white pictures, line drawings, or178\\nautographs by wireless, a combination of the two methods\\njust mentioned is employed; the second method being\\nused for sending, and the first or selenium method for\\nreceiving. For true half-tone pictures the selenium method\\nis used at each end.',\n",
       " 'Wireless telegraphy is probably the most remarkable and\\nat the same time the most interesting of all the varied\\napplications of electricity. The exceptional popular\\ninterest in wireless communication, as compared with most\\nof the other daily tasks which electricity is called upon\\nto perform, is easy to understand. The average man does\\nnot realize that although we are able to make electricity\\ncome and go at our bidding, we have little certain knowledge\\nof its nature. He is so accustomed to hearing of\\nthe electric current, and of the work it is made to do, that\\nhe sees little to marvel at so long as there is a connecting\\nwire. Electricity is produced by batteries or by a dynamo,\\nsent along a wire, and made to drive the necessary\\nmachinery; apparently it is all quite simple. But take\\naway the connecting wire, and the case is different. In\\nwireless telegraphy electricity is produced as usual, but\\ninstantly it passes out into the unknown, and, as far as\\nour senses can tell, it is lost for ever. Yet at some\\ndistant point, hundreds or even thousands of miles away,\\nthe electrical influence reappears, emerging from the\\nunknown with its burden of words and sentences. There\\nis something uncanny about this, something suggesting\\ntelepathy and the occult, and herein lies the fascination of\\nwireless telegraphy.',\n",
       " '180',\n",
       " 'The idea of communicating without any connecting\\nwires is an old one. About the year 1842, Morse, of telegraph\\nfame, succeeded in transmitting telegraphic signals\\nacross rivers and canals without a connecting wire. His\\nmethod was to stretch along each bank of the river a wire\\nequal in length to three times the breadth of the river.\\nOne of these wires was connected with the transmitter and\\nwith a battery, and the other with a receiver, both wires\\nterminating in copper plates sunk in the water. In this\\ncase the water took the place of a connecting wire, and\\nacted as the conducting medium. A few years later\\nanother investigator, a Scotchman named Lindsay, succeeded\\nin telegraphing across the river Tay, at a point\\nwhere it is over a mile and a half wide, by similar methods.\\nLindsay appears to have been the first to suggest the possibility\\nof telegraphing across the Atlantic, and although at\\nthat time, 1845, the idea must have seemed a wild one, he\\nhad the firmest faith in its ultimate accomplishment.',\n",
       " 'Amongst those who followed Lindsay’s experiments\\nwith keen interest was the late Sir William, then Mr.\\nPreece, but it was not until 1882, twenty years after\\nLindsay’s death, that he commenced experiments on his\\nown account. In March of that year the cable across the\\nSolent failed, and Preece took the opportunity of trying to\\nsignal across without a connecting wire. He used two\\noverhead wires, each terminating in large copper plates\\nsunk in the sea, one stretching from Southampton to\\nSouthsea Pier, and the other from Ryde Pier to Sconce\\nPoint. The experiment was successful, audible Morse\\nsignals being received on each side. In this experiment,\\nas in those of Morse and Lindsay, the water acted as the\\nconducting medium; but a year or two later, Preece\\nturned his attention to a different method of wireless communication,\\nby means of induction. This method was181\\nbased upon the fact that at the instant of starting and\\nstopping a current in one wire, another current is induced\\nin a second wire placed parallel to it, even when the two\\nwires are a considerable distance apart. Many successful\\nexperiments in this induction telegraphy were made, one\\nof the most striking being that between the Island of Mull\\nand the mainland, in 1895. The cable between the island\\nand the mainland had broken, and by means of induction\\nperfect telegraphic communication was maintained during\\nthe time that the cable was being repaired. Although this\\nsystem of wireless telegraphy is quite successful for short\\ndistances, it becomes impracticable when the distance is\\nincreased, because the length of each of the two parallel\\nwires must be roughly equal to the distance between them.\\nThese experiments of Preece are of great interest, but we\\nmust leave them because they have little connexion with\\npresent-day wireless telegraphy, in which utterly different\\nmethods are used.',\n",
       " 'All the commercial wireless systems of to-day depend\\nupon the production and transmission of electric waves.\\nAbout the year 1837 it was discovered that the discharge\\nof a Leyden jar did not consist of only one sudden rush of\\nelectricity, but of a series of electric oscillations, which\\nsurged backwards and forwards until electric equilibrium\\nwas restored. This discovery was verified by later\\nexperimenters, and it forms the foundation of our knowledge\\nof electric waves. At this point many readers probably\\nwill ask, “What are electric waves?” It is impossible to\\nanswer this question fully, for we still have a great deal to\\nlearn about these waves, and we only can state the conclusions\\nat which our greatest scientists have arrived after\\nmuch thought and many experiments. It is believed that\\nall space is filled with a medium to which the name\\n“ether” has been given, and that this ether extends182\\nthroughout the matter. We do not know what the ether\\nis, but the important fact is that it can receive and transmit\\nvibrations in the form of ether waves. There are different\\nkinds of ether waves, and they produce entirely different\\neffects. Some of them produce the effect which we call\\nlight, and these are called “light waves.” Others produce\\nthe effect known as heat, and they are called “heat waves”;\\nand still others produce electricity, and these we call\\n“electric waves.” These waves travel through the ether at\\nthe enormous speed of 186,000 miles per second, so that\\nthey would cross the Atlantic Ocean in about 1/80 second.\\nThe fact that light also travels at this speed suggested that\\nthere might be some connexion between the two sets of\\nwaves, and after much experiment it has been demonstrated\\nthat the waves of light and electricity are identical except\\nin their length.',\n",
       " 'Later on in this chapter we shall have occasion to refer\\nfrequently to wave-length, and we may take this opportunity\\nof explaining what is understood by this term. Wave-length\\nis the distance measured from the crest of one wave\\nto the crest of the next, across the intervening trough or\\nhollow. From this it will be seen that the greater the\\nwave-length, the farther apart are the waves; and also that\\nif we have two sets of waves of different wave-lengths but\\ntravelling at the same speed, then the number of waves\\narriving at any point in one second will be greater in the\\ncase of the shorter waves, because these are closer together.',\n",
       " 'A tuning-fork in vibration disturbs the surrounding air,\\nand sets up air waves which produce the effect called sound\\nwhen they strike against the drums of our ears. In a\\nsimilar way the discharge of a Leyden jar disturbs the\\nsurrounding ether, and sets up electric ether waves; but\\nthese waves produce no effect upon us in the shape of sight,\\nsound, or feeling. There is however a very simple piece183\\nof apparatus which acts as a sort of electric eye or ear, and\\ndetects the waves for us. This consists of a glass tube\\nloosely filled with metal filings, and having a cork at each\\nend. A wire is passed through each cork so as to project\\nwell into the tube, but so that the two ends do not touch\\none another, and the outer ends of these wires are connected\\nto a battery of one or two cells, and to some kind of\\nelectrically worked apparatus, such as an electric bell. So\\nlong as the filings lie quite loosely in the tube they offer\\na very high resistance, and no current passes. If now\\nelectric waves are set up by the discharge of a Leyden jar,\\nthese waves fall upon the tube and cause the resistance\\nof the filings to decrease greatly. The filings now form a\\nconducting path through which the current passes, and so\\nthe bell rings. If no further discharge takes place the\\nelectric waves cease, but the filings do not return to their\\noriginal highly resistant condition, but retain their conductivity,\\nand the current continues to pass, and the bell\\ngoes on ringing. To stop the bell it is only necessary\\nto tap the tube gently, when the filings immediately fall\\nback into their first state, so that the current cannot pass\\nthrough them.',\n",
       " 'Now let us see how the “coherer,” as the filings tube is\\ncalled, is used in actual wireless telegraphy. Fig. 33a\\nshows a simple arrangement for the purpose. A is an\\ninduction coil, and B the battery supplying the current.\\nThe coil is fitted with a spark gap, consisting of two\\nhighly polished brass balls CC, one of these balls being\\nconnected to a vertical wire supported by a pole, and the\\nother to earth. D is a Morse key for starting and stopping\\nthe current. When the key is pressed down, current flows\\nfrom the battery to the coil, and in passing through the\\ncoil it is raised to a very high voltage, as described in\\nChapter VIII. This high tension current is sent into the184\\naerial wire, which quickly becomes charged up to its\\nutmost limits. But more current continues to arrive, and\\nso the electricity in the aerial, unable to bear any longer\\nthe enormous pressure, takes the only path of escape and\\nbursts violently across the air gap separating the brass\\nballs. Surging oscillations are then produced in the aerial,\\nthe ether is violently disturbed, and electric waves are\\nset in motion. This is the transmitting part of the\\napparatus.',\n",
       " 'If a stone is dropped into a pond, little waves are set in185\\nmotion, and these spread outwards in ever-widening rings.\\nElectric waves also are propagated outwards in widening\\nrings, but instead of travelling in one plane only, like the\\nwater waves, they proceed in every plane; and when they\\narrive at the receiving aerial they set up in it oscillations\\nof the same nature as those which produced the waves.\\nLet us suppose electric waves to reach the aerial wire of\\nFig. 33b. The resistance of the coherer H is at once lowered\\nso that current from battery N flows and operates the relay\\nF, which closes the circuit of battery M. This battery\\nhas a twofold task. It operates the sounder E, and it\\nenergizes the electro-magnet of the de-coherer K, as shown\\nby the dotted lines. This de-coherer is simply an electric\\nbell without the gong, arranged so that the hammer strikes\\nthe coherer tube; and its purpose is to tap the tube\\nautomatically and much more rapidly than is possible by\\nhand. The sounder therefore gives a click, and the de-coherer\\ntaps the tube, restoring the resistance of the\\nfilings. The circuit of battery N is then broken, and the\\nrelay therefore interrupts the circuit of battery M. If\\nwaves continue to arrive, the circuits are again closed,\\nanother click is given, and again the hammer taps the\\ntube. As long as waves are falling upon the aerial, the\\nalternate makings and breakings of the circuits follow one\\nanother very rapidly and the sounder goes on working.\\nWhen the waves cease, the hammer of the de-coherer has\\nthe last word, and the circuits of both batteries remain\\nbroken. To confine the electric waves to their proper\\nsphere two coils of wire, LL, called choking coils, are\\ninserted as shown.',\n",
       " 'In this simple apparatus we have all the really essential\\nfeatures of a wireless installation for short distances. For\\nlong distance work various modifications are necessary,\\nbut the principle remains exactly the same. In land wireless186\\nstations the single vertical aerial wire becomes an\\nelaborate arrangement of wires carried on huge masts and\\ntowers. The distance over which signals can be transmitted\\nand received depends to a considerable extent upon\\nthe height of the aerial, and consequently land stations\\nhave the supporting masts or towers from one to several\\nhundred feet in height, according to the range over which\\nit is desired to work. As a rule the same aerial is used both\\nfor transmitting and receiving, but some stations have a\\nseparate aerial for each purpose. A good idea of the\\nappearance of commercial aerials for long distance working\\nmay be obtained from the frontispiece, which shows the\\nMarconi station at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, from which\\nwireless communication is held with the Marconi station at\\nClifden, in Galway, Ireland.',\n",
       " 'In the first wireless stations what is called a “plain\\naerial” transmitter was used, and this was almost the same\\nas the transmitting apparatus in Fig. 33a, except, of course,\\nthat it was on a larger scale. This arrangement had many\\nserious drawbacks, including that of a very limited range,\\nand it has been abandoned in favour of the “coupled”\\ntransmitter, a sketch of which is shown in Fig. 34. In this\\ntransmitter there are two separate circuits, having the same\\nrate of oscillation. A is an induction coil, supplied with\\ncurrent from the battery B, and C is a condenser. A\\ncondenser is simply an apparatus for storing up charges of\\nelectricity. It may take a variety of forms, but in every\\ncase it must consist of two conducting layers separated by\\na non-conducting layer, the latter being called the\\n“dielectric.” The Leyden jar is a condenser, with conducting\\nlayers of tinfoil and a dielectric of glass, but the\\ncondensers used for wireless purposes generally consist of\\na number of parallel sheets of metal separated by glass or\\nmica, or in some cases by air only. The induction coil187\\ncharges up the condenser with high tension electricity, until\\nthe pressure becomes so great that the electricity is\\ndischarged in the form of a spark between the brass balls\\nof the spark gap D. The accumulated electric energy in\\nthe condenser then surges violently backwards and forwards,\\nand by induction corresponding surgings are produced in\\nthe aerial circuit, these latter surgings setting up electric\\nwaves in the ether.',\n",
       " 'For the sake of simplicity we have represented the\\napparatus as using an induction coil, but in all stations of\\nany size the coil is replaced by a step-up transformer, and188\\nthe current is supplied either from an electric light power\\nstation at some town near by, or from a power house specially\\nbuilt for the purpose. Alternating current is generally used,\\nand if the current supplied is continuous, it is converted into\\nalternating current. This may be done by making the\\ncontinuous current drive an electric motor, which in turn\\ndrives a dynamo generating alternating current. In any\\ncase, the original current is too low in voltage to be used\\ndirectly, but in passing through the transformer it is raised\\nto the required high pressure. The transmitting key,\\nwhich is inserted between the dynamo and the transformer,\\nis specially constructed to prevent the operator from receiving\\naccidental shocks, and the spark gap is enclosed in a\\nsort of sound-proof box, to deaden the miniature thunders\\nof the discharge.',\n",
       " 'During the time that signals are being transmitted,\\nsparks follow one another across the spark gap in rapid\\nsuccession, a thousand sparks per second being by no\\nmeans an uncommon rate. The violence of these rapid\\ndischarges raises the brass balls of the gap to a great heat.\\nThis has the effect of making the sparking spasmodic and\\nuncertain, with the result that the signals at the receiving\\nstation are unsatisfactory. To get over this difficulty\\nMarconi introduced a rotary spark gap. This is a wheel\\nwith projecting knobs or studs, mounted on the shaft of the\\ndynamo supplying the current, so that it rotates rapidly.\\nTwo stationary knobs are fixed so that the wheel rotates\\nbetween them, and the sparks are produced between these\\nfixed knobs and those of the wheel, a double spark gap\\nthus being formed. Overheating is prevented by the\\ncurrents of air set up by the rapid movement of the wheel,\\nand the sparking is always regular.',\n",
       " 'In the receiving apparatus already described a filings\\ncoherer was used to detect the ether waves, and, by means\\nof a local battery, to translate them into audible signals with\\na sounder, or printed signals with a Morse inker. This\\ncoherer however is unsuitable for commercial working.\\nIt is not sufficiently sensitive, and it can be used only for\\ncomparatively short distances; while its action is so slow\\nthat the maximum speed of signalling is not more than\\nabout seventeen or eighteen words a minute. A number\\nof different detectors of much greater speed and sensitiveness\\nhave been devised. The most reliable of these,\\nthough not the most sensitive, is the Marconi magnetic detector,\\nPlate XIII.b. This consists of a moving band made\\nof several soft iron wires twisted together, and passing close\\nto the poles of two horse-shoe magnets. As the band\\npasses from the influence of one magnet to that of the other\\nits magnetism becomes reversed, but the change takes a\\ncertain amount of time to complete owing to the fact that\\nthe iron has some magnetic retaining power, so that it\\nresists slightly the efforts of one magnet to reverse the\\neffect of the other. The moving band passes through two\\nsmall coils of wire, one connected with the aerial, and the\\nother with a specially sensitive telephone receiver. When\\nthe electric waves from the transmitting station fall upon\\nthe aerial of the receiving station, small, rapidly oscillating\\ncurrents pass through the first coil, and these have the\\neffect of making the band reverse its magnetism instantly.\\nThe sudden moving of the lines of magnetic force induces\\na current in the second coil, and produces a click in the\\ntelephone. As long as the waves continue, the clicks\\nfollow one another rapidly, and they are broken up into the\\nlong and short signals of the Morse code according to the\\nmanipulation of the Morse key at the sending station.\\nExcept for winding up at intervals the clockwork mechanism\\nwhich drives the moving band, this detector requires no\\nattention, and it is always ready for work.',\n",
       " '190',\n",
       " 'Another form of detector makes use of the peculiar\\npower possessed by certain crystals to rectify the oscillatory\\ncurrents received from the aerial, converting them into\\nuni-directional currents. At every discharge of the condenser\\nat the sending station a number of complete waves,\\nforming what is called a “train” of waves, is set in motion.\\nFrom each train of waves the crystal detector produces one\\nuni-directional pulsation of current, and this causes a click\\nin the telephone receiver. If these single pulsations follow\\none another rapidly and regularly, a musical note is heard\\nin the receiver. Various combinations of crystals, and\\ncrystals and metal points, are used, but all work in the\\nsame way. Some combinations work without assistance,\\nbut others require to have a small current passed through\\nthem from a local battery. The crystals are held in small\\ncups of brass or copper, mounted so that they can be\\nadjusted by means of set-screws. Crystal detectors are\\nextremely sensitive, but they require very accurate adjustment,\\nand any vibration quickly throws them out of order.',\n",
       " 'The “electrolytic” detector rectifies the oscillating\\ncurrents in a different manner. One form consists of a thin\\nplatinum wire passing down into a vessel made of lead,\\nand containing a weak solution of sulphuric acid. The\\ntwo terminals of a battery are connected to the wire and\\nthe vessel respectively. As long as no oscillations are\\nreceived from the aerial the current is unable to flow\\nbetween the wire and the vessel, but when the oscillations\\nreach the detector the current at once passes, and operates\\nthe telephone receiver. The action of this detector is not\\nthoroughly understood, and the way in which the point of\\nthe platinum wire prevents the passing of the current until\\nthe oscillations arrive from the aerial is something of a\\nmystery.',\n",
       " 'The last detector that need be described is the Fleming191\\nvalve receiver. This consists of an electric incandescent\\nlamp, with either carbon or tungsten filament, into which\\nis sealed a plate of platinum connected with a terminal outside\\nthe lamp. The plate and the filament do not touch\\none another, but when the lamp is lighted up a current can\\nbe passed from the plate to the filament, but not from filament\\nto plate. This receiver acts in a similar way to the\\ncrystal detector, making the oscillating currents into uni-directional\\ncurrents. It has proved a great success for\\ntransatlantic wireless communication between the Marconi\\nstations at Clifden and Glace Bay, and is extensively used.',\n",
       " 'The electric waves set in motion by the transmitting\\napparatus of a wireless station spread outwards through\\nthe ether in all directions, and so instead of reaching only\\nthe aerial of the particular station with which it is desired\\nto communicate, they affect the aerials of all stations within\\na certain range. So long as only one station is sending\\nmessages this causes no trouble; but when, as is actually\\nthe case, large numbers of stations are hard at work transmitting\\ndifferent messages at the same time, it is evident\\nthat unless something can be done to prevent it, each of\\nthese messages will be received at the same moment by\\nevery station within range, thus producing a hopeless confusion\\nof signals from which not a single message can be\\nread. Fortunately this chaos can be avoided by what is\\ncalled “tuning.”',\n",
       " 'Wireless tuning consists in adjusting the aerial of the\\nreceiving station so that it has the same natural rate of\\noscillation as that of the transmitting station. A simple\\nexperiment will make clearer the meaning of this. If we\\nstrike a tuning-fork, so that it sounds its note, and while it\\nis sounding strongly place near it another fork of the same\\npitch and one of a different pitch, we find that the fork of\\nsimilar pitch also begins to sound faintly, whereas the third192\\nfork remains silent. The explanation is that the two forks\\nof similar pitch have the same natural rate of vibration,\\nwhile the other fork vibrates at a different rate. When\\nthe first fork is struck, it vibrates at a certain rate, and sets\\nin motion air waves of a certain length. These waves\\nreach both the other forks, but their effect is different in\\neach case. On reaching the fork of similar pitch the first\\nwave sets it vibrating, but not sufficiently to give out a\\nsound. But following this wave come others, and as the\\nfork has the same rate of vibration as the fork which\\nproduced the waves, each wave arrives just at the right\\nmoment to add its impulse to that of the preceding wave,\\nso that the effect accumulates and the fork sounds. In the\\ncase of the third fork of different pitch, the first wave sets\\nit also vibrating, but as this fork cannot vibrate at the same\\nrate as the one producing the waves, the latter arrive at\\nwrong intervals; and instead of adding together their\\nimpulses they interfere with one another, each upsetting\\nthe work of the one before it, and the fork does not sound.\\nThe same thing may be illustrated with a pendulum. If\\nwe give a pendulum a gentle push at intervals corresponding\\nto its natural rate of swing, the effects of all these\\npushes are added together, and the pendulum is made to\\nswing vigorously. If, on the other hand, we give the pushes\\nat longer or shorter intervals, they will not correspond with\\nthe pendulum’s rate of swing, so that while some pushes\\nwill help the pendulum, others will hinder it, and the final\\nresult will be that the pendulum is brought almost to a\\nstandstill, instead of being made to swing strongly and\\nregularly. The same principle holds good with wireless\\naerials. Any aerial will respond readily to all other aerials\\nhaving the same rate of oscillation, because the waves in\\neach case are of the same length; that is to say, they follow\\none another at the same intervals. On the other hand, an193\\naerial will not respond readily to waves from another aerial\\nhaving a different rate of oscillation, because these do not\\nfollow each other at intervals to suit it.',\n",
       " 'If each station could receive signals only from stations\\nhaving aerials similar to its own, its usefulness would be\\nvery limited, and so all stations are provided with means\\nof altering the rate of oscillation of their aerials. The\\nactual tuning apparatus by which this is accomplished need\\nnot be described, as it is complicated, but what happens in\\npractice is this: The operator, wearing telephone receivers\\nfixed over his ears by means of a head band, sits at a\\ndesk upon which are placed his various instruments. He\\nadjusts the tuning apparatus to a position in which\\nsignals from stations of widely different wave-lengths are\\nreceived fairly well, and keeps a general look out over\\npassing signals. Presently he hears his own call-signal,\\nand knows that some station wishes to communicate with\\nhim. Immediately he alters the adjustment of his tuner\\nuntil his aerial responds freely to the waves from this\\nstation, but not to waves from other stations, and in this\\nway he is able to cut out signals from other stations and to\\nlisten to the message without interruption.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately wireless tuning is yet far from perfect in\\ncertain respects. For instance, if two stations are transmitting\\nat the same time on the same wave-length, it is\\nclearly impossible for a receiving operator to cut one out\\nby wave-tuning, and to listen to the other only. In such\\na case, however, it generally happens that although the\\nwave-frequency is the same, the frequency of the wave\\ngroups or trains is different, so that there is a difference\\nin the notes heard in the telephones; and a skilful operator\\ncan distinguish between the two sufficiently well to read\\nwhichever message is intended for him. The stations\\nwhich produce a clear, medium-pitched note are the easiest194\\nto receive from, and in many cases it is possible to identify\\na station at once by its characteristic note. Tuning is also\\nunable to prevent signals from a powerful station close at\\nhand from swamping to some extent signals from another\\nstation at a great distance, the nearer station making the\\nreceiving aerial respond to it as it were by brute force,\\ntuning or no tuning.',\n",
       " 'Another source of trouble lies in interference by atmospheric\\nelectricity. Thunderstorms, especially in the\\ntropics, interfere greatly with the reception of signals,\\nthe lightning discharges giving rise to violent, irregular\\ngroups of waves which produce loud noises in the telephones.\\nThere are also silent electrical disturbances in the\\natmosphere, and these too produce less strong but equally\\nweird effects. Atmospheric discharges are very irregular,\\nwithout any real wave-length, so that an operator cannot\\ncut them out by wave-tuning pure and simple in the way\\njust described, as they defy him by affecting equally all\\nadjustments. Fortunately, the irregularity of the atmospherics\\nproduces correspondingly irregular sounds in the\\ntelephones, quite unlike the clear steady note of a wireless\\nstation; and unless the atmospherics are unusually strong\\nthis note pierces through them, so that the signals can be\\nread. The effects of lightning discharges are too violent\\nto be got rid of satisfactorily, and practically all that can\\nbe done is to reduce the loudness of the noises in the\\ntelephones, so that the operator is not temporarily deafened.\\nDuring violent storms in the near neighbourhood of a\\nstation it is usual to connect the aerial directly to earth,\\nso that in the event of its being struck by a flash the\\nelectricity passes harmlessly away, instead of injuring the\\ninstruments, and possibly also the operators. Marconi\\nstations are always fitted with lightning-arresters.',\n",
       " 'The methods and apparatus we have described so far195\\nare those of the Marconi system, and although in practice\\nadditional complicated and delicate pieces of apparatus are\\nused, the description given represents the main features of\\nthe system. Although Marconi was not the discoverer of\\nthe principles of wireless telegraphy, he was the first to\\nproduce a practical working system. In 1896 Marconi came\\nfrom Italy to England, bringing with him his apparatus,\\nand after a number of successful demonstrations of its\\nworking, he succeeded in convincing even the most sceptical\\nexperts that his system was thoroughly sound. Commencing\\nwith a distance of about 100 yards, Marconi\\nrapidly increased the range of his experiments, and by\\nthe end of 1897 he succeeded in transmitting signals\\nfrom Alum Bay, in the Isle of Wight, to a steamer 18\\nmiles away. In 1899 messages were exchanged between\\nBritish warships 85 miles apart, and the crowning achievement\\nwas reached in 1901, when Marconi received readable\\nsignals at St. John’s, Newfoundland, from Poldhu in Cornwall,\\na distance of about 1800 miles. In 1907 the Marconi\\nstations at Clifden and Glace Bay were opened for public\\nservice, and by the following year transatlantic wireless\\ncommunication was in full swing. The sending of wireless\\nsignals across the Atlantic was a remarkable accomplishment,\\nbut it did not represent by any means the limits\\nof the system, as was shown in 1910. In that year\\nMarconi sailed for Buenos Ayres, and wireless communication\\nwith Clifden was maintained up to the almost incredible\\ndistance of 4000 miles by day, and 6735 miles by night.\\nThe Marconi system has had many formidable rivals, but\\nit still holds the proud position of the most successful commercial\\nwireless system in the world.',\n",
       " 'We have not space to give a description of the other\\ncommercial systems, but a few words on some of the chief\\npoints in which they differ from the Marconi system may196\\nbe of interest. We have seen that an ordinary spark gap,\\nformed by two metal balls a short distance apart, becomes\\noverheated by the rapid succession of discharges, with the\\nresult that the sparking is irregular. What actually\\nhappens is that the violent discharge tears off and vaporizes\\nminute particles of the metal. This intensely heated\\nvapour forms a conducting path which the current is able\\nto cross, so that an arc is produced just in the same way\\nas in the arc lamp. This arc is liable to be formed by\\neach discharge, and it lasts long enough to prevent the\\nsparks from following one another promptly. In the\\nMarconi system this trouble is avoided by means of a\\nrotating spark gap, but in the German “Telefunken”\\nsystem, so named from Greek tele, far off, and German\\nFunke, a spark, a fixed compound spark gap is used\\nfor the same purpose. This consists of a row of metal\\ndiscs about 1/100 inch apart, and the spark leaps these\\ntiny gaps one after the other. The discs are about\\n3 inches in diameter, and their effect is to conduct away\\nquickly the heat of the discharge. By this means the\\nformation of an arc is prevented, and the effect of each\\ndischarge is over immediately, the sparks being said to be\\n“quenched.” The short discharges enable more energy to\\nbe radiated from the aerial into the ether, and very high\\nrates of sparking are obtained, producing a high-pitched\\nmusical note.',\n",
       " 'The “Lepel” system also uses a quenched spark.\\nThe gap consists of two metal discs clamped together and\\nseparated only by a sheet of paper. The paper has a hole\\nthrough its centre, and through this hole the discharge\\ntakes place, the discs being kept cool by water in constant\\ncirculation. The discharge is much less noisy than in the\\nMarconi and Telefunken systems, and the musical note\\nproduced is so sensitive that by varying the adjustments197\\nsimple tunes can be played, and these can be heard quite\\ndistinctly in the telephone at the receiving stations.',\n",
       " 'In the three systems already mentioned spark\\ndischarges are used to set up oscillatory currents in the\\naerial, which in turn set up waves in the ether. Each\\ndischarge sets in motion a certain number of waves,\\nforming what is known as a train of waves. The discharges\\nfollow one another very rapidly, but still there is a\\nminute interval between them, and consequently there is a\\ncorresponding interval between the wave-trains. In the\\n“Goldschmidt” system the waves are not sent out in\\ngroups of this kind, but in one long continuous stream.\\nThe oscillatory currents which produce ether waves are\\nreally alternating currents which flow backwards and\\nforwards at an enormous speed. The alternating current\\nproduced at an ordinary power station is of no use for\\nwireless purposes, because its “frequency,” or rate of flow\\nbackwards and forwards, is far too low. It has been\\nfound possible however to construct special dynamos\\ncapable of producing alternating current of the necessary\\nhigh frequency, and such dynamos are used in the\\nGoldschmidt system. The dynamos are connected directly\\nto the aerial, so that the oscillatory currents in the latter\\nare continuous, and the ether waves produced are continuous\\nalso.',\n",
       " 'The “Poulsen” system produces continuous waves in\\nan altogether different manner, by means of the electric\\narc. The arc is formed between a fixed copper electrode\\nand a carbon electrode kept in constant rotation, and it is\\nenclosed in a kind of box filled with methylated spirit\\nvapour, hydrogen, or coal gas. A powerful electro-magnet\\nis placed close to the arc, so that the latter is surrounded\\nby a strong magnetic field. Connected with the terminals\\nof the arc is a circuit consisting of a condenser and a coil198\\nof wire, and the arc sets up in this circuit oscillatory\\ncurrents which are communicated to the aerial. These\\ncurrents are continuous, and so also are the resulting\\nwaves.',\n",
       " 'The method of signalling employed in these two\\ncontinuous-wave systems is quite different from that used\\nin the Marconi and other spark systems. It is practically\\nimpossible to signal by starting and stopping the alternating-current\\ndynamos or the arc at long or short intervals to\\nrepresent dashes or dots. In one case the sudden changes\\nfrom full load to zero would cause the dynamo to vary its\\nspeed, and consequently the wave-length would be\\nirregular; besides which the dynamo would be injured by\\nthe sudden strains. In the other case it would be\\nextremely difficult to persuade the arc to start promptly\\neach time. On this account the dynamo and the arc are\\nkept going continuously while a message is being transmitted,\\nand the signals are given by altering the wave-length.\\nIn other words, the transmitting aerial is thrown\\nin and out of tune alternately at the required long or short\\nintervals, and the receiving aerial responds only during the\\n“in-tune” intervals.',\n",
       " 'The various receiving detectors previously described\\nare arranged to work with dis-continuous waves, producing\\na separate current impulse from each group or train of\\nwaves. In continuous wave systems there are of course\\nno separate groups, and for this reason these detectors are\\nof no use, and a different arrangement is required. The\\noscillatory currents set up in the aerial are allowed to\\ncharge up a condenser, and this condenser is automatically\\ndisconnected from the aerial and connected to the operator’s\\ntelephones at regular intervals of about 1/1000 second.\\nEach time the condenser is connected to the telephones\\nit is discharged, and a click is produced. These clicks199\\ncontinue only as long as the waves are striking the aerial,\\nand as the transmitting operator interrupts the waves at\\nlong or short intervals the clicks are split up into groups of\\ncorresponding length.',\n",
       " 'Continuous waves have certain advantages over dis-continuous\\nwaves, particularly in the matter of sharp\\ntuning, but these advantages are outweighed to a large\\nextent by weak points in the transmitting apparatus. The\\ndynamos used to produce the high-frequency currents in\\nthe Goldschmidt system are very expensive to construct\\nand troublesome to keep in order; while in the Poulsen\\nsystem the arc is difficult to keep going for long periods,\\nand it is liable to fluctuations which greatly affect its\\nworking power.

Still\\nmore peculiar is the fact that it is easier to signal in a\\nnorth and south direction than in an east and west\\ndirection.

A long land line\\npassing through wild country, and exposed to all kinds of\\nweather, requires constant labour to keep it in good repair,\\nand when a breakdown occurs at any point, the repairing\\ngang may be miles away, so that delay is caused. On the\\nother hand, whatever may go wrong at a wireless station,\\nno time is lost in effecting the necessary repairs, for everything\\nis on the spot.',\n",
       " 'At present there is no great competition between wireless204\\nand ordinary telegraphy for overland messages of any\\nkind, but the case is different when we come to communication\\nacross seas and oceans. Already the cable companies have\\nbeen affected considerably, and there is little doubt that\\nthey will feel the competition much more seriously before\\nlong. The general public, always conservative in such\\nmatters, have not yet grasped the fact that telegrams can\\nbe handed in at any telegraph office in the British Isles,\\nand at most telegraph offices in the United States and\\nCanada, for wireless transmission across the Atlantic, via\\nthe Marconi stations at Clifden and Glace Bay. The cost\\nis remarkably small, being eightpence a word for ordinary\\nmessages.',\n",

The information available about these 700 stations\\nis incomplete in many cases, but about 500 are controlled\\nby various departments of the governments of the different\\nstates. Of the remainder, about 100 are controlled by the\\nMarconi Company, the rest being in the hands of various\\nwireless, commercial, or railway companies.',\n",

In\\nChapter IV. we saw how a current of high voltage could\\nbe obtained by connecting a number of cells in series, and\\nat these stations the necessary high voltage is produced by\\nconnecting a number of powerful dynamos in series, on the205\\nsame principle. Along with the dynamos a huge battery\\nof accumulators, consisting of about 6000 cells, is used as\\na sort of reservoir of current.

In the days when wireless\\nwas unknown, a navigator was thrown entirely upon his\\nown resources as soon as his vessel was out of sight of\\nland, for no information of any kind could reach him.\\nEven with a wireless installation on board, the captain of a\\nvessel still needs the same skill and watchfulness as of old,\\nbut in the times of uncertainty and danger to which all\\nships are liable, he often is able to obtain information which\\nmay prevent disaster.

To avoid the possibility of\\nmistakes from this cause, wireless time signals are sent out\\nat regular intervals by certain high-power stations, and as\\nlong as a vessel is within range of one of these stations the\\nslightest variation in the chronometers may be detected\\nimmediately. Amongst these stations are the Eiffel Tower,\\ngiving time signals at 10 a.m. and at midnight; and Norddeich,\\nGermany, giving signals at noon and midnight.\\nThese time signals have proved most useful also on land,\\nmore particularly for astronomers and for explorers engaged\\non surveying work.',\n",

A ship encountering\\nice, or a derelict, reports its discovery to other ships\\nand to the shore stations, and in this way vessels coming\\nalong the same route are warned of the danger in time to\\ntake the necessary precautions. Weather reports are issued\\nregularly from various shore stations in most parts of the\\nworld. The completeness of the information given varies207\\na good deal with different stations, but in many cases it\\nincludes a report of the existing state of the weather at a\\nnumber of different places, a forecast of the winds likely\\nto be encountered at sea, say at a distance of 100 miles\\nfrom land, and warnings of approaching storms, with\\nremarks on any special atmospheric conditions at the time\\nof sending.

       " 'The improvement in the conditions of ocean travel\\nwrought by wireless telegraphy is very remarkable. The\\ndays when a vessel, on passing out of sight of land, entered\\nupon a period of utter isolation, is gone for ever. Unless\\nit strays far from all recognized trade routes, a ship fitted\\nwith a wireless installation is never isolated; and with the\\nrapidly increasing number of high-power stations both on\\nland and sea, it soon will be almost impossible for a vessel\\nto find a stretch of ocean beyond the reach of wave-borne\\nmessages. The North Atlantic Ocean is specially remarkable\\nfor perfection of wireless communication. For the\\nfirst 250 miles or so after leaving British shores, liners are\\nwithin reach of various coast stations, and beyond this\\nPoldhu takes up the work and maintains communication\\nup to about mid-Atlantic. On passing beyond the reach208\\nof Poldhu, liners come within range of other Marconi\\nstations at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Cape Race,\\nNewfoundland, so that absolutely uninterrupted communication\\nis maintained throughout the voyage. On many\\nliners a small newspaper is published daily, in which are\\ngiven brief accounts of the most striking events of the\\nprevious day, together with Stock Exchange quotations and\\nmarket prices. This press news is sent out during the\\nnight from Poldhu and Cape Cod.

Small ships come as low as 50 miles, while a\\nfew exceptional vessels have night ranges up to 1200 or\\neven 2500 miles. Although an outward-bound vessel is\\nalmost always within range of some high-power shore\\nstation, it is evident that it soon must reach a point beyond\\nwhich it is unable to communicate directly with the shore.\\nThis difficulty is overcome by a system of relaying from\\nship to ship. The vessel wishing to speak with the shore\\nhands on its message to some other vessel nearer to land\\nor with a longer range, and this ship sends forward the\\nmessage to a shore station if one is within its reach, and if\\nnot to a third vessel, which completes the transmission.',\n",

Time after\\ntime we have read thrilling accounts of ocean disasters in\\nwhich wireless has come to the rescue in the most wonderful\\nway. A magnificent liner, with its precious human\\nfreight, steams majestically out of harbour, and ploughs its209\\nway out into the waste of waters. In mid-ocean comes\\ndisaster, swift and awful, and the lives of all on board are\\nin deadly peril. Agonized eyes sweep the horizon, but no\\nsail is in sight, and succour seems hopeless. But on the\\ndeck of that vessel is a small, unpretentious cabin, and at a\\ndesk in that cabin sits a young fellow with strange-looking\\ninstruments before him. At the first tidings of disaster he\\npresses a key, and out across the waters speed electric\\nwaves bearing the wireless cry for help, “S.O.S.,” incessantly\\nrepeated. Far away, on another liner, is a\\nsimilar small cabin, and its occupant is busy with messages\\nof everyday matters. Suddenly, in the midst of his work,\\ncomes the call from the stricken vessel, and instantly all\\nelse is forgotten. No matter what the message in hand, it\\nmust wait, for lives are in danger. Quickly the call is\\nanswered, the position of the doomed ship received, and\\nthe captain is informed. A few orders are hurriedly given,\\nthe ship’s course is changed, and away she steams to the\\nrescue, urged on by the full power of her engines. In an\\nhour or two she arrives alongside, boats are lowered, and\\npassengers and crew are snatched from death and placed\\nin safety. This scene, with variations, has been enacted\\nmany times, and never yet has wireless failed to play its\\npart. It is only too true that in some instances many\\nlives have been lost, but in these cases it is necessary to\\nremember that without wireless every soul on board might\\nhave gone down. The total number of lives already saved\\nby wireless is estimated at about 5000, and of these some\\n3000 have been saved in the Atlantic.',\n",
       " 'Ship aerials are carried from one mast to another, as\\nhigh up as possible. The transmitting and receiving\\napparatus is much the same as in land stations, so that it\\nneed not be described. In addition, most liners carry a\\nlarge induction coil and a suitable battery, so that distress210\\nsignals can be transmitted even when the ordinary\\napparatus is rendered useless by the failure of the current\\nsupply. Most of the wireless systems are represented\\namongst ship installations, but the great majority of vessels\\nhave either Marconi or Telefunken apparatus.',\n",

       " 'Wireless telegraphy apparently has a useful future in\\nrailway work. In spite of the great perfection of present-day\\nrailway signalling, no railway company is able to avoid\\noccasional accidents. Some of these accidents are due to\\ncircumstances which no precautions can guard against\\nentirely, such, for instance, as the sudden breakage of some\\nportion of the mechanism of the train itself. In many cases,\\nhowever, the accident is caused by some oversight on the\\npart of the signalman or the engine-driver. Probably the\\ngreat majority of such accidents are not due to real carelessness\\nor inattention to duty, but to unaccountable freaks\\nof the brain, through which some little detail, never before\\nforgotten, is overlooked completely until too late. We all211\\nare liable to these curious mental lapses, but happily in most\\ncases these do not lead to disaster of any kind. The ever-present\\npossibility of accidents brought about in this way is\\nrecognized fully by railway authorities, and every effort is\\nmade to devise mechanism which will safeguard a train in\\ncase of failure of the human element. The great weakness\\nof the ordinary railway system is that there is no reliable\\nmeans of communicating with the driver of a train except\\nby the fixed signals, so that when a train has passed one\\nset of signals it is generally beyond the reach of a message\\nuntil it arrives at the next set. On the enterprising\\nLackawanna Railroad, in the United States, an attempt has\\nbeen made to remove this defect by means of wireless\\ntelegraphy, and the experiment has been remarkably\\nsuccessful. Wireless communication between moving\\npassenger trains and certain stations along the route has\\nbeen established, and the system is being rapidly developed.',\n",
       " 'The wireless equipment of the stations is of the usual\\ntype, and does not call for comment, but the apparatus on\\nthe trains is worth mention. The aerial, which must be\\nlow on account of bridges and tunnels, consists of rectangles\\nof wire fixed at a height of 18 inches above the roof of\\neach car. These separate aerials are connected together\\nby a wire running to a small operating room containing a\\nset of Marconi apparatus, and situated at the end of one of\\nthe cars. The earth connexion is made to the track rails,\\nand the current is taken from the dynamos used to supply\\nthe train with electric light. With this equipment messages\\nhave been transmitted and received while the train was\\nrunning at the rate of 70 miles an hour, and distances\\nup to 125 miles have been covered. During a severe\\nstorm in the early part of last year the telegraph and\\ntelephone lines along the railroad broke down, but\\nuninterrupted communication was maintained by wireless,212\\nand the operations of the relief gangs and the snow-ploughs\\nwere directed by this means. For emergency signalling\\nthis system is likely to prove of enormous importance. If\\nsignals are set wrongly, through some misunderstanding,\\nand a train which should have been held up is passed\\nforward into danger, it can be stopped by a wireless message\\nin time to prevent an accident. Again, if a train has a\\nbreakdown, or if it sticks fast in a snow-drift, its plight and\\nits exact position can be signalled to the nearest station, so\\nthat help may be sent without delay. The possibilities of\\nthe system in fact are almost unlimited, and it seems not\\nunlikely that wireless telegraphy will revolutionize the\\nlong-distance railway travelling of the future.',\n",
       " 'In our chapter on the accumulator or storage cell we saw\\nthat a current of electricity has the power of decomposing\\ncertain liquids; that is to say, it is able to split them up\\ninto their component parts. This power has given rise\\nto the important art of electroplating and electrotyping.\\nElectroplating is the process of depositing a coating of a\\nrarer metal, such as gold, silver, or nickel, upon the\\nsurface of baser or commoner metals; and electrotyping is\\nthe copying of casts, medals, types, and other similar\\nobjects. The fact that metals could be deposited by the\\ndecomposition of a solution by a current was known in the\\nearly days of the voltaic cell, but no one seems to have\\npaid much attention to it. An Italian chemist published\\nin 1805 an account of his success in coating two silver\\nmedals with gold, and some thirty years later Bessemer\\ntransformed lead castings into fairly presentable ornaments\\nby coating them with copper, but commercial electroplating\\nmay be said to have begun about 1840, when an\\nEnglishman named Elkington took out a patent for the\\nprocess. Since then the processes of electroplating and\\nelectrotyping have rapidly come more and more into use,\\nuntil to-day they are practised on a vast scale, giving employment\\nto thousands.',\n",
       " 'Electroplating on a small scale is a very simple affair.\\nA solution of the metal which it is desired to deposit is214\\nplaced in a suitable vessel. Two metal rods are placed\\nacross the top of this vessel, and from one of these is\\nsuspended a plate of the same metal as that in the solution,\\nand from the other is hung the article to receive the\\ncoating. The positive terminal of a voltaic battery is\\nconnected to the rod supporting the plate, and the negative\\nterminal to the rod carrying the article to be plated. As\\nthe current passes through the solution from the plate to the\\narticle the solution is decomposed, and the article receives\\na coating of metal. The solution through which the\\ncurrent passes, and which is decomposed, is called the\\nelectrolyte, and the terminal points at which the current\\nenters and leaves the solution are called electrodes. The\\nelectrode by which the current enters the electrolyte is\\ncalled the anode, and the one by which it leaves is called\\nthe cathode.',\n",
       " 'If we wish to deposit a coating of copper on, say, an\\nold spoon which has been dismissed from household service,\\na solution of sulphate of copper must be made up and\\nplaced in a glass or stoneware jar. Two little rods of\\nbrass, copper, or any other good conductor are placed\\nacross the jar, one at each side, and by means of hooks of\\nwire a plate of copper is hung from one rod and the spoon\\nfrom the other. The positive terminal of a battery of\\nDaniell cells is then connected to the anode rod which\\nsupports the copper plate, and the negative terminal to\\nthe cathode rod carrying the spoon. The current now\\ncommences its task of splitting up the copper-sulphate\\nsolution into pure copper and sulphuric acid, and depositing\\nthis copper upon the spoon. The latter is very quickly\\ncovered with a sort of “blush” copper, and the coating\\ngrows thicker and thicker as long as the current is kept\\nat work. If there were no copper plate forming the anode\\nthe process would soon come to a standstill, on account of215\\nthe copper in the electrolyte becoming used up; but as it\\nis the sulphuric acid separated out of the electrolyte takes\\ncopper from the plate and combines with it to form a\\nfurther supply of copper sulphate. In this way the strength\\nof the solution is kept up, and the copper anode becomes\\nsmaller and smaller as the coating on the spoon increases\\nin thickness. It is not necessary that the anode should\\nconsist of absolutely pure copper, because any impurities\\nwill be precipitated to the bottom or mixed with the\\nsolution, nothing but quite pure copper being deposited on\\nthe spoon. At the same time if the copper anode is very\\nimpure the electrolyte quickly becomes foul, and has to be\\npurified or replaced by new solution.',\n",
       " 'To nickel-plate the spoon we should require a nickel\\nplate for the anode and a nickel solution; to silver-plate it,\\na silver anode and solution, and so on. Fig. 35 shows at\\nsimple but effective arrangement for amateur electroplating\\nin a small way.',\n",
       " 'Electroplating on a commercial scale is of course a\\nmuch more elaborate process, but the principle remains\\nexactly the same. Fig. 36 shows the general arrangement\\nof a plating shop. It is obviously extremely important216\\nthat the deposit on a plated article should be durable, and\\nto ensure that the coating will adhere firmly the article\\nmust be cleaned thoroughly before being plated. Cleanliness\\nin the ordinary domestic sense is not sufficient, for\\nthe article must be chemically clean. Some idea of the\\ncare required in this respect may be gained from the fact\\nthat if the cleaned surface is touched with the hand before\\nbeing plated, the coating will strip off the parts that have\\nbeen touched. The surfaces are first cleaned mechanically,\\nand then chemically by immersion in solutions of acids or\\nalkalies, the cleaning process varying to some extent with\\ndifferent metals. There is also a very interesting process\\nof cleaning by electricity. The article is placed in a vat\\nfitted with anode and cathode rods, just as in an ordinary\\nplating vat, and containing a solution of hydrate of potash\\nand cyanide of potassium. The anode consists of a carbon\\nplate, and the article is hung from the cathode rod.\\nSufficient current is passed through the solution to cause\\ngas to be given off rapidly at the cathode, and as this gas\\nrises to the surface it carries with it the grease and dirt\\nfrom the article, in the form of a dirty scum. After a\\nshort time the article becomes oxidized and discoloured,\\nand the current is then reversed, so that the article becomes\\nthe anode, and the carbon plate the cathode. The\\ncurrent now removes the oxide from the surface of the\\narticle, which is left quite bright and chemically clean.',\n",
       " 'When thoroughly cleaned the articles are ready to be\\nplaced in the plating vats. These vats are usually made\\nof wood lined with chemically pure lead, or of iron lined\\nwith enamel or cement. Anode and cathode rods made\\nof brass are placed across the vats, and from these the\\nanodes of the various metals and the articles to be plated\\nare hung by hooks of nickel or brass. Any number of\\nrods may be used, according to the size of the vat, so long218\\nas the articles have an anode on each side. If three rods\\nare used the articles are hung from the centre one, and the\\nanodes from the outside ones. If a number of small\\narticles are to be plated together they are often suspended\\nin perforated metal trays. Small articles are also plated\\nby placing them in a perforated barrel of wood, or wood\\nand celluloid, which revolves in the solution. While the\\narticles are being plated the revolving of the barrel makes\\nthem rub one against the other, so that they are brightly\\nburnished. Dog chains, cycle chain links, button-hooks,\\nand harness fittings are amongst the articles plated by\\nmeans of the revolving barrel.',\n",
       " 'The strength of current required for different kinds of\\nplating varies considerably, and if the work is to be of the\\nbest quality it is very important that the current should be\\nexactly right for the particular process in hand. In order\\nto adjust it accurately variable resistances of German silver\\nwire are provided for each vat, the current having to pass\\nthrough the resistance before reaching the solution. The\\nvolume and the pressure of the current are measured by\\namperemeters and voltmeters attached to the resistance\\nboards. If the intensity of the current is too great the\\narticles are liable to be “burnt,” when the deposit is dark\\ncoloured and often useless.',\n",
       " 'When exceptionally irregular surfaces have to be plated\\nit is sometimes necessary to employ an anode of special\\nshape, in order to keep as uniform a distance as possible\\nbetween the electrodes. If this is not done, those parts of\\nthe surface nearest the anode get more than their share of\\nthe current, and so they receive a thicker deposit than the\\nparts farther away.',\n",
       " 'An interesting process is that known as “parcel-plating,”\\nby which decorative coatings of different coloured metals\\ncan be deposited on one article. For instance, if it is219\\ndesired to have gold flowers on a silver brooch, the parts\\nwhich are not to be gilded are painted over with a non-conducting\\nvarnish. When this varnish is quite dry the\\nbrooch is placed in the gilding vat and the current sent\\nthrough in the usual way. The gold is then deposited only\\non the parts unprotected by varnish, and after the gilding\\nthe varnish is easily removed by softening it in turpentine\\nand brushing with a bristle brush. More elaborate\\ncombinations of different coloured metals can be made in\\nthe same way.',\n",
       " 'Sugar basins, cream jugs, ornamental bowls, cigarette\\ncases, and other articles are often gilded only on the inside.\\nThe article is filled with gold solution and connected to the\\ncathode rod. A piece of gold wrapped in calico is attached\\nto the anode rod, suspended in the solution inside the\\narticle, and moved about quickly until the deposit is of the\\nrequired thickness.',\n",
       " 'The time occupied in plating is greatly shortened by\\nstirring or agitating the solutions. This sets up a good\\ncirculation of the liquid, and a continual supply of fresh\\nsolution is brought to the cathode. At the same time the\\nresistance to the current is decreased, and more current\\nmay be used without fear of burning. Fig. 37 shows an\\narrangement for this purpose. The solution is agitated by\\ncompressed air, and at the same time the cathode rods are\\nmoved backwards and forwards. Plating solutions are\\nalso frequently heated in order to hasten the rate of\\ndeposition.',\n",
       " 'When the plating process is complete, the articles are\\nremoved from the vat, thoroughly swilled in water, and\\ndried. They are then ready for finishing by polishing and\\nburnishing, or they may be given a sort of frosted surface.\\nDuring the finishing processes the appearance of the articles\\nchanges considerably, the rather dead-looking surface220\\nproduced by the plating giving place to the bright lustre\\nof the particular metal.',\n",
       " 'It sometimes happens that an article which has been\\nplated and polished shows little defects here and there in\\nthe deposit. In such a case it is not necessary to re-plate\\nthe whole article, for the defects can be made good by a221\\nprocess of “doctoring.” A piece of the same metal as that\\nforming the deposit is placed between two pieces of wood,\\nand a wire fastened to one end of it. At the other end\\nseveral thicknesses of flannel are wrapped round and\\nsecurely tied. This strip, which forms a miniature anode,\\nis connected to the anode rod of the plating vat, and the\\narticle is connected to the cathode rod. The flannel is\\nsaturated with the plating solution, and the strip is rubbed\\ngently over the defective places until the deposit formed is\\nas thick as that on the rest of the article. If the work is\\ndone carefully the “doctored” portions cannot be distinguished\\nfrom the rest of the surface.',\n",
       " 'Electroplating may be employed to give ships’ plates\\na coating of copper to prevent barnacles from sticking to\\nthem.

Practically\\nall materials can be electroplated, but if they are non-conductors\\nthey must be given a conducting surface in the\\nway just described or by some similar means. Even\\nflowers and insects may be plated, and by giving them first\\na coating of copper and then a coating of gold, delicately\\nbeautiful results are obtained.',\n",
       " 'Electrotyping is practically the same as electroplating,\\nexcept that the coating is removed from the support on\\nwhich it is deposited. The process is largely used for\\ncopying engraved plates for printing purposes. The plate222\\nis first rubbed over with a very weak solution of beeswax\\nin turpentine, to prevent the deposit from adhering to it,\\nand it is then placed in a copperplating vat and given a\\ngood thick coating. The coating is then stripped off, and\\nin this way a reversed copy of the plate is obtained. This\\ncopy is then replaced in the vat, and a coating of copper\\ndeposited upon it, and this coating, when stripped off, forms\\nan exact reproduction of the original, with every detail\\nfaithfully preserved. An engraved plate may be copied\\nalso by making from it a mould of plaster or composition.\\nThe surface of this mould is then rendered conducting by\\nsprinkling over it a quantity of plumbago, which is well\\nbrushed into all the recesses, and a coating of copper\\ndeposited on it. As the mould was a reversed copy of the\\noriginal, the coating formed upon it is of course an exact\\ncopy of the plate. If the copy has to be made very quickly\\na preliminary deposit of copper is chemically formed on the\\nmould before it is placed in the vat. This is done by\\npouring on to the mould a solution of sulphate of copper,\\nand sprinkling iron filings over the surface. The filings\\nare then brushed down on to the face of the mould with a\\nfine brush, and a chemical reaction takes place, resulting in\\nthe precipitation of copper from the solution. After the\\nfilings have been washed away, the mould is placed in the\\nvat, and the deposition of copper takes place very rapidly.',\n",

For most purposes\\nthese impurities greatly affect the value of the copper, and\\nbefore the metal can be of much commercial use they must\\nbe got rid of in some way. In the previous chapter, in\\ndescribing how to copperplate an old spoon, we saw that\\nthe anode need not consist of pure copper, because in any\\ncase nothing but the pure metal would be deposited upon\\nthe spoon. This fact forms the basis of the important\\nindustry of electrolytic copper refining. The process is\\nexactly the same as ordinary copperplating, except that\\nthe cathode always consists of absolutely pure copper.\\nThis is generally in the form of a sheet no thicker than\\nthin paper, but sometimes a number of suspended wires are\\nused instead. A solution of copper sulphate is used as\\nusual for the electrolyte, and the anode is a thick cast plate\\nof the impure copper. The result of passing a current\\nthrough the solution is that copper is taken from the anode\\nand carried to the cathode, the impurities falling to the\\nbottom of the vat and accumulating as a sort of slime. In\\nthis way thick slabs of pure copper are obtained, ready to\\nbe melted down and cast into ingots.',\n",

It is\\nestimated that about half a million tons of copper are\\nrefined every year. An immense amount of this pure\\ncopper is used for electrical purposes, for making conducting\\nwires and cables, and innumerable parts of electric\\nappliances and machinery of all kinds; in fact it is calculated\\nthat more than half of the copper produced all over the\\nworld is used in this way.',\n",

       " 'The metal aluminium has come into general use with\\nsurprising rapidity, and during the last twenty-five or\\nthirty years the amount of this metal produced annually\\nhas increased from two or three tons to many thousands\\nof tons. Aluminium occurs naturally in large quantities,\\nin the form of alumina, or oxide of aluminium, but for a\\nlong time experimenters despaired of ever obtaining the\\npure metal cheaply on a commercial scale. The oxides of\\nmost metals can be reduced, that is deprived of their oxygen,\\nby heating them with carbon; but aluminium oxide holds\\non to its oxygen with extraordinary tenacity, and absolutely\\nrefuses to be parted from it in this way. One process\\nafter another was tried, without success, and cheap\\naluminium seemed to be an impossibility until about 1887,\\nwhen two chemists, Hall, an American, and Héroult, a226\\nFrenchman, discovered a satisfactory solution of the\\nproblem. These chemists, who were then scarcely out of\\ntheir student days, worked quite independently of one\\nanother, and it is a remarkable fact that their methods,\\nwhich are practically alike, were discovered at almost the\\nsame time. The process is an interesting mixture of\\nelectrolysis and electric heating. An iron crucible containing\\na mixture of alumina, fluorspar, and cryolite is\\nheated. The two last-named substances are quickly fused,\\nand the alumina dissolves in the resulting fluid. When\\nthe mixture has reached the fluid state, electrodes made of\\ncarbon are dipped into it, and a current is passed through;\\nwith the result that oxygen is given off at the anode, and\\nmetallic aluminium is produced at the cathode, in molten\\ndrops. This molten metal is heavier than the rest of the\\nfluid, and so it falls to the bottom. From here it is drawn\\noff at intervals, while fresh alumina is added as required,\\nso that the process goes on without interruption. After\\nthe first fusing of the mixture no further outside heat is\\nrequired, for the heat produced by the passage of the\\ncurrent is sufficient to keep the materials in a fluid state.\\nVast quantities of aluminium are produced in this way at\\nNiagara Falls, and in Scotland and Switzerland.',\n",

A solution of this in water\\nis placed in a vat or cell, and a current is sent through it.\\nThe solution is then split up into chlorine, at the anode,\\nand sodium at the cathode. Sodium has a remarkably\\nstrong liking for water, and as soon as it is set free from\\nthe chlorine it combines with the water of the solution, and227\\na new solution of sodium hydrate is formed.

If the\\noxygen and hydrogen are not to be used at the place where\\nthey are produced, they are forced under tremendous\\npressure into steel cylinders, and at a lantern lecture these\\ncylinders may be seen supplying the gas for the lime-light.\\nAlthough the cylinders are specially made and tested for\\nstrength, they are covered with a sort of rope netting; so\\nthat if by any chance one happened to burst, the shattered\\nfragments of metal would be caught by the netting, instead\\nof flying all over the room and possibly injuring a number\\nof people.

       " 'In the chapter on electricity in the atmosphere we saw that\\nwhereas air at ordinary pressure is a bad conductor, its\\nconducting power increases rapidly as the pressure is\\nlowered. Roughly speaking, if we wish to obtain a spark\\nacross a gap of 1 inch in ordinary air, we must have an\\nelectric pressure of about 50,000 volts. The discharge\\nwhich takes place under these conditions is very violent,\\nand it is called a “disruptive” discharge.

If the distance between\\nthe balls has to be, say, half an inch, to produce a spark\\nwith the air at normal pressure, then on slightly reducing\\nthe pressure by means of the air-pump it is found that a\\nspark will pass with the balls an inch or more apart. The\\nbrilliance of an electric spark is due to the resistance of the229\\nair, and as the pressure decreases the resistance becomes\\nsmaller, so that the light produced is much less brilliant.\\nIf the exhaustion is carried still further the discharge\\nbecomes redder in colour, and spreads out wider and wider\\nuntil it loses all resemblance to a spark, and becomes a\\nluminous glow of a purple or violet colour. At first this\\nglow seems to fill the whole bulb, but at still higher vacua\\nit contracts into layers of definite shape, these layers being\\nalternately light and dark. Finally, when the pressure\\nbecomes equal to about one-millionth of an atmosphere, a\\nluminous glow surrounds the cathode or negative rod,\\nbeyond this is dark space almost filling the bulb, and the\\nwalls of the bulb between the cathode and the anode\\nglow with phosphorescent light. This phosphorescence is\\nproduced by rays coming from the cathode and passing\\nthrough the dark space, and these rays have been given the\\nname of “cathode rays.”',\n",
       " 'Many interesting experiments with these rays may be\\nperformed with tubes permanently exhausted to the proper\\ndegree. The power of the rays to produce phosphorescence\\nis shown in a most striking way with a tube fixed in a\\nhorizontal position upon a stand, and containing a light\\ncross made of aluminium, placed in the path of the rays.\\nThis is hinged at the base, so that it can be stood up on end\\nor thrown down by jerking the tube. Some of the rays\\nstreaming from the cathode are intercepted by the cross,\\nwhile others pass by it and reach the other end of the tube.\\nThe result is that a black shadow of the cross is thrown on\\nthe glass, sharply contrasted with those parts of the tube\\nreached by the rays, and which phosphoresce brilliantly.\\nAfter a little while this brilliance decreases, for the glass\\nbecomes fatigued, and loses to a considerable extent its\\npower of phosphorescing. If now the cross is jerked down,\\nthe rays reach the portions of the tube before protected by230\\nthe cross, and this glass, being quite fresh, phosphoresces\\nwith full brilliance. The black cross now suddenly becomes\\nbrilliantly illuminated, while the tired glass is dark in\\ncomparison.

German physicists held that they were of the same\\ncharacter as ordinary light, while English scientists, headed\\nby Sir William Crookes, maintained that they were streams\\nof extremely minute particles of matter in a peculiar fourth\\nstate. That is to say, the matter was not liquid, or solid, or\\ngaseous in the ordinary sense, but was ultra-gaseous, and\\nCrookes gave it the name of radiant matter. Most of us\\nhave been taught to look upon the atom as the smallest\\npossible division of matter, but recent researches have made\\nit clear that the atom itself is divisible. It is believed that\\nan atom is made up of very much more minute particles\\ncalled electrons, which are moving about or revolving all the\\ntime with incredible rapidity. According to Sir Oliver\\nLodge, if we imagine an atom of hydrogen to be as big as\\nan ordinary church, then the electrons which constitute it\\nwill be represented by about 700 grains of sand, 350 being\\npositively electrified and 350 negatively electrified. It is not\\nyet definitely determined whether these electrons are minute231\\nparticles of matter charged with electricity, or whether they\\nare actually atoms of electricity.

In the application of ultra-violet rays to medical\\nwork, artificial light is used in preference to sunlight; for\\nthough the latter contains ultra-violet light, a great deal of\\nit is absorbed in passing through the atmosphere. Besides\\nthis, the sun sends out an immense amount of radiant heat,\\nand this has to be filtered out before the light can be used.\\nThe usual source of light is the electric arc, and the arc is\\nmuch richer in ultra-violet rays if it is formed between\\nelectrodes of iron, instead of the usual carbon rods. The\\nlight, which, in addition to the ultra-violet rays, includes\\nthe blue, indigo, and violet parts of the spectrum, is passed\\nalong a tube something like that of a telescope, and is\\nfocused by means of a double lens, consisting of two\\nseparate plates of quartz. Glass cannot be used for the\\nlens, because it is opaque to the extreme ultra-violet rays.\\nA constant stream of water is passed between the two\\nplates forming the lens, and this filters out the heat rays,\\nwhich are not wanted. In some forms of Finsen lamp an\\nelectric spark is used as the source of light, in place of the\\narc.',\n",
       " 'The most important application of the Finsen light is\\nin the cure of the terribly disfiguring disease called lupus.\\nThis is a form of tuberculosis of the skin, and it is produced\\nby the same deadly microbe which, when it attacks\\nthe lungs, causes consumption. In all but extreme cases\\nthe Finsen light effects a remarkable cure. A number of\\napplications are necessary, each of half an hour or more;245\\nand after a time the disease begins to disappear, leaving\\nsoft, normal skin. The exact action of the light rays is a\\ndisputed point. Finsen himself believed that the ultra-violet\\nrays attacked and exterminated the microbe, but a\\nlater theory is that the rays stimulate the tissues to such\\nan extent that they are enabled to cure themselves. As\\nearly as the year 1899 Finsen had employed his light\\ntreatment in 350 cases of lupus, and out of this number\\nonly five cases were unsuccessful.',\n",

Experiments carried out in Paris,\\nusing a mercury vapour lamp as the source of light, show\\nthat discoloured teeth are whitened and given a pearly\\nlustre by these rays, at the same time being sterilized so\\nthat they do not easily decay. The Röntgen rays are\\nused for the treatment of lupus, and more particularly for\\ndeeper growths, such as tumours and cancers, for which\\nthe Finsen rays are useless, owing to their lack of penetrating\\npower. The action of these two kinds of rays appears\\nto be similar, but the X-rays are much the more active of\\nthe two.',\n",

       " 'As far back as 1785 it was noticed that oxygen became\\nchanged in some way when an electric spark was passed\\nthrough it, and that it acquired a peculiar odour. No\\nparticular attention was paid to the matter however until\\nabout 1840, when Schönbein, a famous German chemist, and\\nthe discoverer of gun-cotton and collodion, became interested\\nin it. He gave this strange smelling substance the name\\nof “ozone,” and he published the results of his experiments\\nwith it in a treatise entitled, “On the Generation of\\nOzone.” Schönbein showed that ozone could be produced\\nby various methods, chemical as well as electrical. For\\ninstance, if a piece of phosphorus is suspended in a jar of\\nair containing also a little water, in such a manner that it\\nis partly in the water and partly out of it, the air acquires\\nthe characteristic smell of ozone, and it is found to have\\ngained increased chemical energy, so that it is a more248\\npowerful oxidizing agent. For a long time the exact\\nchemical nature of ozone could not be determined, mainly\\nbecause it was impossible to obtain the substance in\\nquantities sufficiently large for extensive experimental\\nresearch, but also on account of its extremely energetic\\nproperties, which made it very troublesome to examine.\\nThese difficulties were so great that investigators were in\\ndoubt as to whether ozone was an element or a compound\\nof two or more elements; but finally it was proved that it\\nwas simply oxygen in a condensed or concentrated state.',\n",
       " 'Apparently ozone is formed by the contraction of\\noxygen, so that from three volumes of oxygen two volumes\\nof ozone are produced. In other words, ozone has one and\\na half times the density of oxygen. Ozone has far greater\\noxidizing power than oxygen itself; in fact it is probably\\nthe most powerful of all oxidizing agents, and herein lies\\nits great value. It acts as nature’s disinfectant or sterilizer,\\nand plays a very important part in keeping the air pure,\\nby destroying injurious organic matter. Bacteria apparently\\nhave a most decided objection to dying; at any\\nrate they take an extraordinary amount of killing.

No ozone can be detected\\nin the air of large towns, or over unhealthy swamps or249\\nmarshes.

It is popularly\\nsupposed that the tainting of the air of rooms in\\nwhich large numbers of people are crowded together is due\\nto an excessive amount of carbonic acid gas. This is a\\nmistake, for besides being tasteless and odourless, carbonic\\nacid gas is practically harmless, except in quantities far\\ngreater than ever exist even in the worst ventilated rooms.\\nThe real source of the tainted air is the great amount of\\nanimal matter thrown off as waste products from the skin\\nand lungs, and this tainting is further intensified by the\\nabsence of motion in the air. Even in an over-crowded\\nroom the conditions are made much more bearable if the\\nair is kept in motion, and in a close room ladies obtain\\nrelief by the use of their fans. What we require, therefore,\\nin order to maintain an agreeable atmosphere under\\nall conditions, is some means of keeping the air in gentle\\nmotion, and at the same time destroying as much as possible\\nof the animal matter contained in it. Perhaps the\\nmost interesting and at the same time the most scientific\\nmethod of doing this is by ozone ventilation.',\n",
       " 'In the well-known “Ozonair” system of ventilation,\\nozone is generated by high-tension current. Low-tension\\ncurrent is taken from the public mains or from accumulators,\\nand raised to a very high voltage by passing it through a\\nstep-up transformer. The secondary terminals of the\\ntransformer are connected to a special form of condenser,\\nconsisting of layers of fine metal gauze separated by an\\ninsulating substance called “micanite.” The high tension\\nbetween the gauze layers produces a silent electrical discharge250\\nor glow. A small fan worked by an electric motor\\ndraws the air over the condenser plates, and so a certain\\nproportion of the oxygen is ozonized, and is driven out of\\nthe other side of the apparatus into the room. The amount\\nof ozone generated and the amount of air drawn over the\\ncondenser are regulated carefully, so that the ozonized air\\ncontains rather less than one volume of ozone in one\\nmillion volumes of air, experiment having shown that this\\nis the most suitable strength for breathing. Ozone diluted\\nto this degree has a slight odour which is very refreshing,\\nand besides diminishing the number of organic germs in\\nthe air, it neutralizes unpleasant smells, such as arise from\\ncooking or stale tobacco smoke.

Air is drawn in as shown by the arrows, and\\nby passing through the filter screen F it is freed from dirt\\nand smuts, and from most of the injurious gases which\\nalways are present in town air. The filter screen is kept\\nmoist by a continual flow of water from jets above it, the\\nwaste water falling into the trough W. The ozone\\ngenerator is shown at O. Continuous current at about\\n500 volts, from the power station, is passed through a\\nrotary converter, which turns it into alternating current at\\n380 volts. This current goes to the transformer T, from252\\nwhich it emerges at a pressure of 5000 volts, and is supplied\\nto the ozone generator. From the generator the strongly\\nozonized air is taken by way of the ozone pipe P, to the\\nmixing chamber of the large ventilating fan M, where it is\\nmixed with the main air current and then blown down the\\nmain air trunk.

       " 'The petrol motor, which to-day is busily engaged all over\\nthe world in driving thousands upon thousands of self-propelled\\nvehicles or automobiles, belongs to the important\\nclass of internal-combustion engines. Combustion means\\nthe operation of burning, and an internal-combustion engine\\nis one in which the motive power is produced by the combustion\\nof a highly explosive mixture of gases. In the\\nordinary petrol motor this mixture consists of petrol and air,\\nand it is made by means of a device called a “carburetter.”\\nBy suction, a quantity of petrol is forced through a jet with\\na very fine nozzle, so that it is reduced to an extremely fine\\nspray. A certain proportion of air is allowed to enter, and\\nthe mixture passes into the cylinder. Here it is compressed\\nby the rising piston so that it becomes more and more\\nheated, and at the right point it is ignited. Combustion\\ntakes place with such rapidity that it takes the form of an\\nexplosion, and the energy produced in this way drives\\nforward the piston, which turns the crank-shaft and so\\ncommunicates motion to the driving-wheels.',\n",
       " 'The part played by electricity in this process is confined\\nto the ignition of the compressed charge of petrol and air.\\nThis may be done in two ways; by means of an accumulator\\nand a small induction coil, or by means of a dynamo driven\\nby the engine.

This current\\ngoes through a sparking plug, which is fixed in the head\\nof the cylinder. The sparking plug contains two metal\\npoints separated by a tiny air gap of from about 1/30 to 1/50\\ninch. This gap provides the only possible path for the\\nhigh-tension current, so that the latter leaps across it in\\nthe form of a spark. The spark is arranged to take place\\nwhen the piston is at the top of its stroke, that is, when the\\nexplosive mixture is at its maximum compression, and the\\nheat of the spark ignites the mixture, the resulting explosion\\nforcing down the piston with great power. In practice it\\nis found better as a rule to cause the spark to pass very\\nslightly before the piston reaches the extreme limit of its\\nstroke. The reason of this is that the process of igniting\\nand exploding the charge occupies an appreciable, though\\nof course exceedingly small amount of time. Immediately\\non reaching the top of its stroke the piston begins to\\ndescend again, and if the spark and the top of the stroke\\ncoincide in time the explosion does not take place until the\\npiston has moved some little distance down the cylinder,\\nand so a certain amount of power is lost. By having the\\nspark a little in advance of the piston, the explosion occurs\\nat the instant when the piston begins to return, and so the\\nfull force of the explosion is utilized.',\n",
       " 'In magneto ignition the current is supplied by a small\\ndynamo. This generates alternating current, and it is\\ndriven by the car engine. The current is at first at low\\npressure, and it has to be transformed to high-tension\\ncurrent in order to produce the spark. There are two\\nmethods of effecting this transformation. One is by turning255\\nthe armature of the dynamo into a sort of induction coil, by\\ngiving it two separate windings, primary and secondary;\\nso that the dynamo delivers high-tension current directly.\\nThe other method is to send the low-tension current\\nthrough one or more transformer coils, just as in accumulator\\nignition. Accumulators can give current only for a\\ncertain limited period, and they are liable consequently to\\nrun down at inconvenient times and places. They also\\nhave the defect of undergoing a slight leakage of current\\neven when they are not in use. Magneto ignition has\\nneither of these drawbacks, and on account of its superior\\nreliability it has come into universal use.',\n",
       " 'In the working of quarries and mines of various kinds,\\nand also in large engineering undertakings, blasting plays\\na prominent part.

Many of these accidents are due to the carelessness\\nresulting from long familiarity with the work, but apart\\nfrom this the danger lies principally in uncertainty in\\nexploding the charge. Sometimes the explosion occurs\\nsooner than expected, so that the men have not time to get\\naway to a safe distance. Still more deadly is the delayed\\nexplosion. After making the necessary arrangements the\\nmen retire out of danger, and await the explosion.

This coil\\nis fitted with a spark gap, and the high-tension current goes\\nthrough four or five vacuum valve globes, the invention\\nof Sir Oliver Lodge, which permit the current to pass\\nthrough them in one direction only.

These are arranged to pass only the positive\\ncurrent, and this current is led to overhead wires out in the\\nfield to be electrified. Lemström used wires at a height of\\n18 inches from the ground, but these were very much in\\nthe way, and in the Lodge-Newman system the main wires\\nare carried on large porcelain insulators fixed at the top of\\npoles at a height of about 15 feet.

By means of a specially designed\\nelectric radiator the incubator is kept at the right temperature\\nthroughout the hatching period. When the chickens\\nemerge from the eggs they are transferred to another\\ncontrivance called a “brooder,” which also is electrically\\nheated, the heat being decreased gradually day by day until\\nthe chicks are sturdy enough to do without it.

Gas and water companies keep a record of these\\npipes, with the object of finding any pipe quickly when the\\nnecessity arises; but in spite of such records pipes are\\noften lost, especially where the whole face of the neighbourhood\\nhas changed since the pipes were laid. The finding\\nof a lost pipe by digging is a very troublesome process, and\\neven when the pipe is known to be close at hand, it is quite\\nsurprising how many attempts are frequently necessary\\nbefore it can be located, and its course traced.

       " 'Amongst the many dangers to which ships crossing the\\nAtlantic are exposed is that of collision with icebergs.\\nThese are large masses of ice which have become detached\\nfrom the mighty ice-fields of the north, and which travel\\nslowly and majestically southwards, growing smaller and\\nsmaller as they pass into warmer seas. Icebergs give no\\nwarning of their coming, and in foggy weather, which is very\\nprevalent in the regions where they are encountered, they268\\nare extremely difficult to see until they are at dangerously\\nclose quarters.',\n",
       " 'Attempts have been made to detect the proximity of\\nicebergs by noting the variations in the temperature of the\\nwater. We naturally should expect the temperature of the\\nwater to become lower as we approach a large berg, and\\nthis is usually the case. On the other hand, it has been\\nfound that in many instances the temperature near an\\niceberg is quite as high as, and sometimes higher than the\\naverage temperature of the ocean. For this reason the\\ntemperature test, taken by itself, is not at all reliable. A\\nmuch more certain test is that of the salinity or saltness of\\nthe water. Icebergs are formed from fresh water, and as\\nthey gradually melt during their southward journey the\\nfresh water mixes with the sea water. Consequently the\\nwater around an iceberg is less salt than the water of the\\nopen ocean. The saltness of water may be determined by\\ntaking its specific gravity, or by various chemical processes;\\nbut while these tests are quite satisfactory when performed\\nunder laboratory conditions, they cannot be carried out at sea\\nwith any approach to accuracy. There is however an electrical\\ntest which can be applied accurately and continuously.\\nThe electrical conducting power of water varies greatly with\\nthe proportion of salt present. If the conductivity of normal\\nAtlantic water be taken as 1000, then the conductivity of\\nThames water is 8, and that of distilled water about 1/22.\\nThe difference in conductivity between normal ocean water\\nand water in the vicinity of an iceberg is therefore very great.',\n",
       " 'The apparatus for detecting differences in salinity by\\nmeasuring the conductivity of the water is called a “salinometer,”\\nand its most perfect form, known as the heat-compensated\\nconductivity salinometer, is due to Dr. Myer\\nCoplans. Fig. 43 shows a diagram of this interesting\\npiece of apparatus, which is most ingeniously devised. Two270\\ninsulated electrodes of copper, with platinum points, are\\nsuspended in a U-tube through which the sea water passes\\ncontinuously, as indicated in the diagram. A steady current\\nis passed through the column of water between the two\\nplatinum points, and the conductivity of this column is\\nmeasured continuously by very accurate instruments.\\nVariations in the conductivity, indicating corresponding\\nvariations in the saltness of the water, are thus shown\\nimmediately; but before these indications can be relied\\nupon the instrument must be compensated for temperature,\\nbecause the conductivity of the water increases with a rise,\\nand decreases with a fall in temperature. This compensation\\nis effected by the compound bars of brass and steel\\nshown in the vessel at the right of the figure. These bars\\nare connected with the wheel and disc from which the\\nelectrodes are suspended. When the temperature of the\\nwater rises, the bars contract, and exert a pull upon the\\nwheel and disc, so that the electrodes are raised slightly in\\nthe U-tube. This increases the length of the column of\\nwater between the platinum points, and so increases the\\nresistance, or, what amounts to the same thing, lowers the\\nconductivity, in exact proportion to the rise in temperature.\\nSimilarly, a fall in temperature lowers the electrodes, and\\ndecreases the resistance by shortening the column of water.\\nIn this way the conductivity of the water remains constant\\nso far as temperature is concerned, and it varies only with\\nthe saltness of the water. Under ordinary conditions a\\nconsiderable decrease in the salinity of the water indicates\\nthe existence of ice in the near neighbourhood, but the\\ngeographical position of the ship has to be taken into\\naccount. Rivers such as the St. Lawrence pour vast\\nquantities of fresh water into the ocean, and the resulting\\ndecrease in the saltness of the water within a considerable\\nradius of the mouth of the river must be allowed for.',\n",

       " 'Considerable interest was aroused last year by a model\\nof a railway working upon a very remarkable system. This\\nwas the invention of Mr. Emile Bachelet, and the model\\nwas brought to London from the United States. The main\\nprinciple upon which the system is based is interesting.\\nAbout 1884, Professor Elihu Thompson, a famous American\\nscientist, made the discovery that a plate of copper could be\\nattracted or repelled by an electro-magnet. The effects\\ntook place at the moment when the magnetism was varied\\nby suddenly switching the current on or off; the copper\\nbeing repelled when the current was switched on, and\\nattracted when it was switched off. Copper is a non-magnetic\\nsubstance, and the attraction and repulsion are\\nnot ordinary magnetic effects, but are due to currents\\ninduced in the copper plate at the instant of producing or\\ndestroying the magnetism. The plate is attracted or\\nrepelled according to whether these induced currents flow in\\nthe same direction as, or in the opposite direction to, the\\ncurrent in the magnet coil. Brass and aluminium plates\\nact in the same way as the copper plate, and the effects are\\nproduced equally well by exciting the magnet with alternating\\ncurrent, which, by changing its direction, changes the\\nmagnetism also. Of the two effects, the repulsion is\\nmuch the stronger, especially if the variations in the\\nmagnetism take place very rapidly; and if a powerful\\nand rapidly alternating current is used, the plate is repelled\\nso strongly that it remains supported in mid-air above the\\nmagnet.',\n",
       " 'This repulsive effect is utilized in the Bachelet system\\n(Plate XV.). There are no rails in the ordinary sense, and\\nthe track is made up of a continuous series of electro-magnets.272\\nThe car, which is shaped something like a cigar,\\nhas a floor of aluminium, and contains an iron cylinder,\\nand it runs above the line of magnets. Along each side\\nof the track is a channel guide rail, and underneath the car\\nat each end are fixed two brushes with guide pieces, which\\nrun in the guide rails. Above the car is a third guide rail,\\nand two brushes with guide pieces fixed on the top of the\\ncar, one at each end, run in this overhead rail. These\\nguide rails keep the car in position, and also act as conductors\\nfor the current. The repulsive action of the\\nelectro-magnets upon the aluminium floor raises the car\\nclear of the track, and keeps it suspended; and while\\nremaining in this mid-air position it is driven, or rather\\npulled forward, by powerful solenoids, which are supplied\\nwith continuous current. We have referred previously to\\nthe way in which a solenoid draws into it a core of iron.\\nWhen the car enters a solenoid, the latter exerts a pulling\\ninfluence upon the iron cylinder inside the car, and so the\\ncar is given a forward movement. This is sufficient to\\ncarry it along to the next solenoid, which gives it another\\npull, and so the car is drawn forward from one solenoid\\nto another to the end of the line. The model referred\\nto has only a short track of about 30 feet, with one\\nsolenoid at each end; but its working shows that the\\npulling power of the solenoids is sufficient to propel the\\ncar.',\n",
       " 'To avoid the necessity of keeping the whole of the\\nelectro-magnets energized all the time, these are arranged\\nin sections, which are energized separately. By means of\\nthe lower set of brushes working in the track guides, each\\nof these sections has alternating current supplied to it as\\nthe car approaches, and switched off from it when the car\\nhas passed. The brushes working in the overhead guide\\nsupply continuous current to each solenoid as the car enters\\nit, and switch off the current when the car has passed\\nthrough. The speed at which the model car travels is\\nquite extraordinary, and the inventor believes that in actual\\npractice speeds of more than 300 miles an hour are attainable\\non his system.',\n",

The chief difficulty with aeroplanes lies in the\\naerial. This must take the form either of a long trailing\\nwire or of fixed wires running between the planes and the\\ntail.

This is a great\\nadvantage, but against it must be set possible failure of the\\ndefence at a critical moment owing to thick weather, which\\nof course interferes seriously with the careful observation\\nof the mine field necessary for accurate timing of the explosions.\\nThis difficulty may be surmounted by a contact\\nsystem of firing. In this case the mines are placed so near\\nthe surface as to make contact with vessels passing over\\nthem. The observers on shore are informed of the contact\\nby means of an electric impulse automatically transmitted\\nalong the cable, so that they are independent of continuous\\nvisual observation of the mined area. As in the previous\\nsystem, the observers give the actual firing impulse. The\\ndrawback to this method is the necessity for special pilotage\\narrangements for friendly ships in order to avoid unnecessary\\nstriking of the mines, which are liable to have their\\nmechanism deranged by constant blows. If the harbour or285\\nchannel can be closed entirely to friendly shipping, the\\nobservers may be dispensed with, their place being taken\\nby automatic electric apparatus which fires at once any mine\\nstruck by a vessel.',\n",
       " 'Shore-controlled mines are excellent for harbour\\ndefence, and a carefully distributed mine-field, backed by\\nheavy fort guns, presents to hostile vessels a barrier which\\nmay be regarded as almost impenetrable. A strong fleet\\nmight conceivably force its way through, but in so doing it\\nwould sustain tremendous losses; and as these losses would\\nbe quite out of proportion to any probable gains, such an\\nattempt is not likely to be made except as a last resort.',\n",
       " 'For use in the open sea a different type of mine is\\nrequired. This must be quite self-contained and automatic\\nin action, exploding when struck by a passing vessel. The\\nexploding mechanism may take different forms. The blow\\ngiven by a ship may be made to withdraw a pin, thus\\nreleasing a sort of plunger, which, actuated by a powerful\\nspring, detonates the charge. A similar result is obtained\\nby the use of a suspended weight, in place of plunger and\\nspring. Still another form of mine is fired electrically by\\nmeans of a battery, the circuit of which is closed automatically\\nby the percussion. Deep-sea mines may be anchored\\nor floating free. Free mines are particularly dangerous on\\naccount of the impossibility of knowing where they may be\\nat any given moment. They are liable to drift for considerable\\ndistances, and to pass into neutral seas; and to\\nsafeguard neutral shipping international rules require them\\nto have some sort of clockwork mechanism which renders\\nthem harmless after a period of one hour. It is quite\\ncertain that some, at least, of the German free mines have\\nno such mechanism, so that neutral shipping is greatly\\nendangered.',\n",
       " 'Submarine mines are known as ground mines, or286\\nbuoyant mines, according to whether they rest on the sea\\nbottom or float below the surface. Ground mines are\\ngenerally made in the form of a cylinder, buoyant mines\\nbeing usually spherical. The cases are made of steel, and\\nbuoyancy is given when required by enclosing air spaces.\\nOpen-sea mines are laid by special vessels, mostly old\\ncruisers. The stern of these ships is partly cut away, and\\nthe mines are run along rails to the stern, and so overboard.\\nThe explosive employed is generally gun-cotton, fired by\\na detonator, charges up to 500 lb. or more being used,\\naccording to the depth of submersion and the horizontal\\ndistance at which the mine is desired to be effective.\\nGround mines can be used only in shallow water, and even\\nthen they require a heavier charge than mines floating near\\nthe surface. Mines must not be laid too close together, as\\nthe explosion of one might damage others. The distance\\napart at which they are placed depends upon the amount\\nof charge, 500-lb. mines requiring to be about 300 feet apart\\nfor safety.',\n",
       " 'The question which heads this, our final chapter, is one\\nwhich must occur to every one who takes even the most\\ncasual interest in matters scientific, and it would be very\\nsatisfactory if we could bring this volume to a conclusion\\nby providing a full and complete answer. Unfortunately\\nthis is impossible. In years to come the tireless labours of\\nscientific investigators may lead to a solution of the problem;\\nbut, as Professor Fleming puts it: “The question—What\\nis electricity?—no more admits of a complete and final\\nanswer to-day than does the question—What is life?”',\n",
       " 'From the earliest days of electrical science theories of\\nelectricity have been put forward. The gradual extension\\nand development of these theories, and the constant substitution\\nof one idea for another as experimental data\\nincreased, provide a fascinating subject for study. To\\ncover this ground however, even in outline, would necessitate\\nmany chapters, and so it will be better to consider\\nonly the theory which, with certain reservations in some\\ncases, is held by the scientific world of to-day. This is\\nknown as the electron theory of electricity.',\n",
       " 'We have referred already, in Chapter XXIV., to atoms\\nand electrons. All matter is believed to be constituted\\nof minute particles called “atoms.” These atoms are so\\nextremely small that they are quite invisible, being far\\nbeyond the range of the most powerful microscope; and\\ntheir diameter has been estimated at somewhere about one288\\nmillionth of a millimetre. Up to a few years ago the atom\\nwas believed to be quite indivisible, but it has been proved\\nbeyond doubt that this is not the case. An atom may be\\nsaid to consist of two parts, one much larger than the\\nother. The smaller part is negatively electrified, and is\\nthe same in all atoms; while the larger part is positively\\nelectrified, and varies according to the nature of the atom.\\nThe small negatively electrified portion of the atom consists of\\nparticles called “electrons,” and these electrons are believed\\nto be indivisible units or atoms of negative electricity. To\\nquote Professor Fleming: “An atom of matter in its neutral\\ncondition has been assumed to consist of an outer shell or\\nenvelope of negative electrons associated with some core or\\nmatrix which has an opposite electrical quality, such that if\\nan electron is withdrawn from the atom the latter is left\\npositively electrified.”',\n",
       " 'The electrons in an atom are not fixed, but move with\\ngreat velocity, in definite orbits. They repel one another,\\nand are constantly endeavouring to fly away from the atom,\\nbut they are held in by the attraction of the positive core.\\nSo long as nothing occurs to upset the constitution of the\\natom, a state of equilibrium is maintained and the atom is\\nelectrically neutral; but immediately the atom is broken up\\nby the action of an external force of some kind, one or\\nmore electrons break their bonds and fly away to join some\\nother atom. An atom which has lost some of its electrons\\nis no longer neutral, but is electro-positive; and similarly,\\nan atom which has gained additional electrons is electro-negative.\\nElectrons, or atoms of negative electricity, can\\nbe isolated from atoms of matter, as in the case of the\\nstream of electrons proceeding from the cathode of a vacuum\\ntube. So far, however, it has been found impossible to\\nisolate corresponding atoms of positive electricity.',\n",
       " 'From these facts it appears that we must regard a289\\npositively charged body as possessing a deficiency of\\nelectrons, and a negatively charged body as possessing an\\nexcess of electrons. In Chapter I. we spoke of the\\nelectrification of sealing-wax or glass rods by friction, and\\nwe saw that according to the nature of the substance used\\nas the rubber, the rods were either positively or negatively\\nelectrified. Apparently, when we rub a glass rod with a\\npiece of silk, the surface atoms of each substance are\\ndisturbed, and a certain number of electrons leave the glass\\natoms, and join the silk atoms. The surface atoms of the\\nglass, previously neutral, are now electro-positive through\\nthe loss of electrons; and the surface atoms of the silk,\\nalso previously neutral, are now electro-negative through\\nthe additional electrons received from the glass atoms.\\nAs the result we find the glass to be positively, and silk to\\nbe negatively electrified. On the other hand, if we rub the\\nglass with fur, a similar atomic disturbance and consequent\\nmigration of electrons takes place, but this time the glass\\nreceives electrons instead of parting with them. In this case\\nthe glass becomes negatively, and the fur positively electrified.\\nThe question now arises, why is the movement of the electrons\\naway from the glass in the first instance, and toward it in\\nthe second? To understand this we may make use of a\\nsimple analogy. If we place in contact two bodies, one hot\\nand the other cold, the hot body gives up some of its heat\\nto the cold body; but if we place in contact with the hot\\nbody another body which is still hotter, then the hot body\\nreceives heat instead of parting with it. In a somewhat\\nsimilar manner an atom is able to give some of its electrons\\nto another atom which, in comparison with it, is deficient in\\nelectrons; and at the same time it is able to receive electrons\\nfrom another atom which, compared with it, has an\\nexcess of electrons. Thus we may assume that the glass\\natoms have an excess of electrons as compared with290\\nsilk atoms, and a deficiency in electrons as compared with\\nfur atoms.',\n",
       " 'A current of electricity is believed to be nothing more\\nor less than a stream of electrons, set in motion by the\\napplication of an electro-motive force. We have seen that\\nsome substances are good conductors of electricity, while\\nothers are bad conductors or non-conductors. In order to\\nproduce an electric current, that is a current of electrons, it\\nis evidently necessary that the electrons should be free to\\nmove. In good conductors, which are mostly metals, it is\\nbelieved that the electrons are able to move from atom to\\natom without much hindrance, while in a non-conductor\\ntheir movements are hampered to such an extent that inter-atomic\\nexchange of electrons is almost impossible. Speaking on\\nthis point, Professor Fleming says: “There may be (in\\na good conductor) a constant decomposition and recomposition\\nof atoms taking place, and any given electron so to\\nspeak flits about, now forming part of one atom and now of\\nanother, and anon enjoying a free existence. It resembles\\na person visiting from house to house, forming a unit in\\ndifferent households, and, in between, being a solitary\\nperson in the street. In non-conductors, on the other hand,\\nthe electrons are much restricted in their movements, and\\ncan be displaced a little way but are pulled back again\\nwhen released.”',\n",
       " 'Let us try to see now how an electric current is set up\\nin a simple voltaic cell, consisting of a zinc plate and a\\ncopper plate immersed in dilute acid. First we must\\nunderstand the meaning of the word ion. If we place a\\nsmall quantity of salt in a vessel containing water, the salt\\ndissolves, and the water becomes salt, not only at the\\nbottom where the salt was placed, but throughout the\\nwhole vessel. This means that the particles of salt must be\\nable to move through the water. Salt is a chemical291\\ncompound of sodium and chlorine, and its molecules\\nconsist of atoms of both these substances. It is supposed\\nthat each salt molecule breaks up into two parts, one part\\nbeing a sodium atom, and the other a chlorine atom; and\\nfurther, that the sodium atom loses an electron, while the\\nchlorine atom gains one. These atoms have the power of\\ntravelling about through the solution, and they are called\\nions, which means “wanderers.” An ordinary atom is unable\\nto wander about in this way, but it gains travelling power\\nas soon as it is converted into an ion, by losing electrons if\\nit be an atom of a metal, and by gaining electrons if it be\\nan atom of a non-metal.',\n",
       " 'Returning to the voltaic cell, we may imagine that the\\natoms of the zinc which are immersed in the acid are trying\\nto turn themselves into ions, so that they can travel through\\nthe solution. In order to do this each atom parts with two\\nelectrons, and these electrons try to attach themselves to\\nthe next atom. This atom however already has two\\nelectrons, and so in order to accept the newcomers it must\\npass on its own two. In this way electrons are passed on\\nfrom atom to atom of the zinc, then along the connecting\\nwire, and so to the copper plate. The atoms of zinc which\\nhave lost their electrons thus become ions, with power of\\nmovement. They leave the zinc plate immediately, and so\\nthe plate wastes away or dissolves. So we get a constant\\nstream of electrons travelling along the wire connecting the\\ntwo plates, and this constitutes an electric current.',\n",
       " 'The electron theory gives us also a clear conception of\\nmagnetism. An electric current flowing along a wire\\nproduces magnetic effects; that is, it sets up a field of\\nmagnetic force. Such a current is a stream of electrons,\\nand therefore we conclude that a magnetic field is produced\\nby electrons in motion. This being so, we are led to\\nsuppose that there must be a stream of electrons in a steel292\\nmagnet, and this stream must be constant because the\\nmagnetic field of such a magnet is permanent. The\\nelectron stream in a permanent magnet however is not\\nquite the same as the electron stream in a wire conveying a\\ncurrent. We have stated that the electrons constituting an\\natom move in definite orbits, so that we may picture them\\ntravelling round the core of the atom as the planets travel\\nround the Sun. This movement is continuous in every\\natom of every substance. Apparently we have here the\\nnecessary conditions for the production of a magnetic field,\\nthat is, a constant stream of electrons; but one important\\nthing is still lacking. In an unmagnetized piece of steel the\\natoms are not arranged symmetrically, so that the orbits of\\ntheir electrons lie some in one plane and some in another.\\nConsequently, although the electron stream of each atom\\nundoubtedly produces an infinitesimally small magnetic\\nfield, no magnetic effect that we can detect is produced,\\nbecause the different streams are not working in unison and\\nadding together their forces. In fact they are upsetting\\nand neutralizing each other’s efforts. By stroking the piece\\nof steel with a magnet, or by surrounding it by a coil of\\nwire conveying a current, the atoms are turned so that their\\nelectron orbits all lie in the same plane. The electron\\nstreams now all work in unison, their magnetic effects are\\nadded together, and we get a strong magnetic field as the\\nresult of their combined efforts. Any piece of steel or iron\\nmay be regarded as a potential magnet, requiring only a\\nrearrangement of its atoms in order to become an active\\nmagnet. In Chapter VI. it was stated that other substances\\nbesides iron and steel show magnetic effects, and this is what\\nwe should expect, as the electron movement is common to\\nall atoms. None of these substances is equal to iron\\nand steel in magnetic power, but why this is so is not\\nunderstood.',\n",
       " '293',\n",
       " 'This brings us to the production of an electric current by\\nthe dynamo. Here we have a coil of wire moving across a\\nmagnetic field, alternately passing into this field and out of\\nit. A magnetic field is produced, as we have just seen, by\\nthe steady movement of electrons, and we may picture it\\nas being a region of the ether disturbed or strained by the\\neffect of the moving electrons. When the coil of wire\\npasses into the magnetic field, the electrons of its atoms are\\ninfluenced powerfully and set in motion in one direction, so\\nproducing a current in the coil. As the coil passes away\\nfrom the field, its electrons receive a second impetus, which\\nchecks their movement and starts them travelling in the\\nopposite direction, and another current is produced. The\\ncoil moves continuously and regularly, passing into and out\\nof the magnetic field without interruption; and so we get a\\ncurrent which reverses its direction at regular intervals, that\\nis, an alternating current. This current may be made continuous\\nif desired, as explained in Chapter IX.',\n",
       " 'Such, stated briefly and in outline, is the electron theory\\nof electricity. It opens up possibilities of the most fascinating\\nnature; it gives us a wonderfully clear conception of\\nwhat might be called the inner mechanism of electricity; and\\nit even introduces us to the very atoms of electricity.\\nBeyond this, at present, it cannot take us, and the actual\\nnature of electricity itself remains an enigma.',\n",

       "['Although the science of electricity is of comparatively\\nrecent date, electricity itself has existed from the beginning\\nof the world. There can be no doubt that man’s introduction\\nto electricity was brought about through the\\nmedium of the thunderstorm, and from very early times\\ncome down to us records of the terror inspired by thunder\\nand lightning, and of the ways in which the ancients tried\\nto account for the phenomena. Even to-day, although we\\nknow what lightning is and how it is produced, a severe\\nthunderstorm fills us with a certain amount of awe, if not\\nfear; and we can understand what a terrifying experience\\nit must have been to the ancients, who had none of our\\nknowledge.',\n",
       " 'These early people had simple minds, and from our\\npoint of view they had little intelligence; but they possessed\\na great deal of curiosity. They were just as anxious to\\nexplain things as we are, and so they were not content\\nuntil they had invented an explanation of lightning and\\nthunder. Their favourite way of accounting for anything\\nthey did not understand was to make up a sort of romance\\nabout it. They believed that the heavens were inhabited\\nby various gods, who showed their pleasure or anger by2\\nsigns, and so they naturally concluded that thunder was\\nthe voice of angry gods, and lightning the weapon with\\nwhich they struck down those who had displeased them.\\nPrayers and sacrifices were therefore offered to the gods, in\\nthe hope of appeasing their wrath.',\n",
       " 'Greek and Roman mythology contains many references\\nto thunder and lightning. For instance, we read about\\nthe great god Zeus, who wielded thunder-bolts which had\\nbeen forged in underground furnaces by the giant Cyclops.\\nThere was no doubt that the thunder-bolts were made in\\nthis way, because one only had to visit a volcano in order\\nto see the smoke from the furnace, and hear the rumbling\\necho of the far-off hammering. Then we are told the\\ntragic story of Phaeton, son of the Sun-god. This youth,\\nlike many others since his time, was daring and venturesome,\\nand imagined that he could do things quite as well\\nas his father. On one occasion he tried to drive his father’s\\nchariot, and, as might have been expected, it got beyond\\nhis control, and came dangerously near the Earth. The\\nland was scorched, the oceans were dried up, and the whole\\nEarth was threatened with utter destruction. In order to\\nprevent such a frightful catastrophe, Jupiter, the mighty\\nlord of the heavens, hurled a thunder-bolt at Phaeton, and\\nstruck him from the chariot into the river Po. A whole\\nbook could be written about these ancient legends concerning\\nthe thunderstorm, but, interesting as they are, they\\nhave no scientific value, and many centuries were to elapse\\nbefore the real nature of lightning was understood.',\n",
       " 'In order to trace the first glimmerings of electrical\\nknowledge we must leave the thunderstorm and pass on to\\nmore trivial matters. On certain sea-coasts the ancients\\nfound a transparent yellow substance capable of taking a\\nhigh polish, and much to be desired as an ornament; and\\nabout 600 years B.C. it was discovered that this substance,3\\nwhen rubbed, gained the power of drawing to it bits of\\nstraw, feathers, and other light bodies. This discovery is\\ngenerally credited to a Greek philosopher named Thales,\\n941–563 B.C., and it must be regarded as the first step\\ntowards the foundation of electrical science. The yellow\\nsubstance was amber. We now know it to be simply a\\nsort of fossilized resin, but the Greeks gave it a much more\\nromantic origin. When Phaeton’s rashness brought him\\nto an untimely end, his sorrowing sisters, the Heliades,\\nwere changed into poplar trees, and their tears into amber.\\nAmongst the names given to the Sun-god was Alector,\\nwhich means the shining one, and so the tears of the\\nHeliades came to have the name Electron, or the shining\\nthing. Unlike most of the old legends, this story of the\\nfate of the Sun-maidens is of great importance to us, for\\nfrom the word “electron” we get the name Electricity.',\n",
       " 'Thales and his contemporaries seem to have made no\\nserious attempts to explain the attraction of the rubbed\\namber, and indeed so little importance was attached to the\\ndiscovery that it was completely forgotten. About 321 B.C.\\none Theophrastus found that a certain mineral called\\n“lyncurium” gained attractive powers when rubbed, but\\nagain little attention was paid to the matter, and astonishing\\nas it may seem, no further progress worth mention was\\nmade until towards the close of the sixteenth century, when\\nDoctor Gilbert of Colchester began to experiment seriously.\\nThis man was born about 1543, and took his degree of\\ndoctor of medicine at Cambridge in 1569. He was very\\nsuccessful in his medical work, and became President of the\\nCollege of Physicians, and later on physician to Queen\\nElizabeth. He had a true instinct for scientific research,\\nand was not content to accept statements on the authority\\nof others, but tested everything for himself. He found\\nthat sulphur, resin, sealing-wax, and many other substances4\\nbehaved like amber when rubbed, but he failed to get any\\nresults from certain other substances, such as the metals.\\nHe therefore called the former substances “electrics,” and\\nthe latter “anelectrics,” or non-electrics. His researches\\nwere continued by other investigators, and from him dates\\nthe science of electricity.',\n",
       " 'Leaving historical matters for the present, we will\\nexamine the curious power which is gained by substances\\nas the result of rubbing. Amber is not always obtainable,\\nand so we will use in its place a glass\\nrod and a stick of sealing-wax. If the\\nglass rod is rubbed briskly with a dry\\nsilk handkerchief, and then held close\\nto a number of very small bits of paper,\\nthe bits are immediately drawn to the\\nrod, and the same thing occurs if the\\nstick of sealing-wax is substituted for\\nthe glass. This power of attraction is\\ndue to the presence of a small charge\\nof electricity on the rubbed glass and\\nsealing-wax, or in other words, the two\\nsubstances are said to be electrified.\\nBits of paper are unsatisfactory for careful\\nexperimenting, and instead of them\\nwe will use the simple piece of apparatus shown in Fig. 1.\\nThis consists of a ball of elder pith, suspended from a glass\\nsupport by means of a silk thread. If now we repeat our\\nexperiments with the electrified glass or sealing-wax we\\nfind that the little ball is attracted in the same way as the\\nbits of paper. But if we look carefully we shall notice that\\nattraction is not the only effect, for as soon as the ball\\ntouches the electrified body it is driven away or repelled.\\nNow let us suspend, by means of a thread, a glass rod\\nwhich has been electrified by rubbing it with silk, and bring5\\nnear it in turn another silk-rubbed glass rod and a stick of\\nsealing-wax rubbed with flannel. The two glass rods are\\nfound to repel one another, whereas the sealing-wax attracts\\nthe glass. If the experiment is repeated with a suspended\\nstick of sealing-wax rubbed with flannel, the glass and the\\nsealing-wax attract each other, but the two sticks of wax\\nrepel one another. Both glass and sealing-wax are\\nelectrified, as may be seen by bringing them near the pith\\nball, but there must be some difference between them as\\nwe get attraction in one case and repulsion in the other.',\n",
       " 'The explanation is that the electric charges on the silk-rubbed\\nglass and on the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax are of\\ndifferent kinds, the former being called positive, and the\\nlatter negative. Bodies with similar charges, such as the\\ntwo glass rods, repel one another; while bodies with unlike\\ncharges, such as the glass and the sealing-wax, attract each\\nother. We can now see why the pith ball was first\\nattracted and then repelled. To start with, the ball was\\nnot electrified, and was attracted when the rubbed glass or\\nsealing-wax was brought near it. When however the\\nball touched the electrified body it received a share of the\\nlatter’s electricity, and as similar charges repel one another,\\nthe ball was driven away.',\n",
       " 'The kind of electricity produced depends not only on\\nthe substance rubbed, but also on the material used as the\\nrubber. For instance, we can give glass a negative charge\\nby rubbing it with flannel, and sealing-wax becomes\\npositively charged when rubbed with silk. The important\\npoint to remember is that there are only two kinds of\\nelectricity, and that every substance electrified by rubbing\\nis charged either positively, like the silk-rubbed glass, or\\nnegatively, like the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax.',\n",
       " 'If we try to electrify a metal rod by holding it in the\\nhand and rubbing it, we get no result, but if we fasten to6\\nthe metal a handle of glass, and hold it by this while\\nrubbing, we find that it becomes electrified in the same way\\nas the glass rod or the sealing-wax. Substances such as\\nglass do not allow electricity to pass along them, so that in\\nrubbing a glass rod the part rubbed becomes charged, and\\nthe electricity stays there, being unable to spread to the\\nother parts of the rod. Substances such as metals allow\\nelectricity to pass easily, so that when a metal rod is\\nrubbed electricity is produced, but it immediately spreads\\nover the whole rod, reaches the hand, and escapes. If we\\nwish the metal to retain its charge we must provide it with\\na handle of glass or of some other material which does not\\nallow electricity to pass. Dr. Gilbert did not know this,\\nand so he came to the conclusion that metals were non-electrics,\\nor could not be electrified.',\n",
       " 'Substances which allow electricity to pass freely are\\ncalled conductors, and those which do not are called non-conductors;\\nwhile between the two extremes are many\\nsubstances which are called partial conductors. It may be\\nsaid here that no substance is quite perfect in either respect,\\nfor all conductors offer some resistance to the passage of\\nelectricity, while all non-conductors possess some conducting\\npower. Amongst conductors are metals, acids, water,\\nand the human body; cotton, linen, and paper are partial\\nconductors; and air, resin, silk, glass, sealing-wax, and\\ngutta-percha are non-conductors. When a conductor is\\nguarded by a non-conductor so that its electricity cannot\\nescape, it is said to be insulated, from Latin, insula, an\\nisland; and non-conductors are also called “insulators.”',\n",
       " 'So far we have mentioned only the electric charge\\nproduced on the substance rubbed, but the material used as\\nrubber also becomes electrified. The two charges, however,\\nare not alike, but one is always positive and the other\\nnegative. For instance, if glass is rubbed with silk, the7\\nglass receives a positive, and the silk a negative charge.\\nIt also can be shown that the two opposite charges are\\nalways equal in quantity.',\n",
       " 'The two kinds of electricity are generally represented\\nby the signs + and -, the former standing for positive\\nand the latter for negative electricity.',\n",
       " 'The electricity produced by rubbing, or friction, is\\nknown as Static Electricity; that is, electricity in a state of\\nrest, as distinguished from electricity in motion, or current\\nelectricity. The word static is derived from a Greek word\\nmeaning to stand. At the same time it must be understood\\nthat this electricity of friction is at rest only in the\\nsense that it is a prisoner, unable to move. When we\\nproduce a charge of static electricity on a glass rod, by\\nrubbing it, the electricity would escape fast enough if it\\ncould. It has only two possible ways of escape, along the\\nrod and through the air, and as both glass and air are non-conductors\\nit is obliged to remain at rest where it was\\nproduced. On the other hand, as we have seen, the\\nelectricity produced by rubbing a metal rod which is not\\nprotected by an insulating handle escapes instantly, because\\nthe metal is a good conductor.',\n",
       " 'When static electricity collects in sufficient quantities\\nit discharges itself in the form of a bright spark, and we\\nshall speak of these sparks in Chapter III. Static electricity\\nis of no use for doing useful work, such as ringing bells or\\ndriving motors, and in fact, except for scientific purposes,\\nit is more of a nuisance than a help. It collects almost\\neverywhere, and its power of attraction makes it very\\ntroublesome at times. In the processes of textile manufacture\\nstatic electricity is produced in considerable\\nquantities, and it makes its presence known by causing the\\nthreads to stick together in the most annoying fashion. In\\nprinting rooms too it plays pranks, making the sheets of8\\npaper stick together so that the printing presses have to be\\nstopped.',\n",
       " 'Curiously enough, static electricity has been detected in\\nthe act of interfering with the work of its twin brother,\\ncurrent electricity. A little while ago it was noticed that\\nthe electric incandescent lamps in a certain building were\\nlasting only a very short time, the filaments being found\\nbroken after comparatively little use. Investigations\\nshowed that the boy was in the habit of dusting the lamp\\nglobes with a feather duster. The friction set up in this\\nway produced charges of electricity on the glass, and this\\nhad the effect of breaking the filaments. When this\\nmethod of dusting was discontinued the trouble ceased, and\\nthe lamps lasted their proper number of hours.',\n",
       " 'The amount of electricity produced by the rubbing of glass\\nor sealing-wax rods is very small, and experimenters soon\\nfelt the need of apparatus to produce larger quantities. In\\n1675 the first electrical machine was made by Otto von\\nGuericke, the inventor of the air-pump. His machine consisted\\nof a globe of sulphur fixed on a spindle, and rotated\\nwhile the hands were pressed against it to provide the\\nnecessary friction. Globes and cylinders of glass soon\\nreplaced the sulphur globe, and the friction was produced\\nby cushions instead of by the hands. Still later, revolving\\nplates of glass were employed. These machines worked\\nwell enough in a dry atmosphere, but were very troublesome\\nin wet weather, and they are now almost entirely\\nsuperseded by what are known as influence machines.',\n",
       " 'In order to understand the working of influence\\nmachines, it is necessary to have a clear idea of what is\\nmeant by the word influence as used in an electrical sense.\\nIn the previous chapter we saw that a pith ball was\\nattracted by an electrified body, and that when the ball\\ntouched that body it received a charge of electricity.\\nWe now have to learn that one body can receive a charge\\nfrom another body without actual contact, by what is called\\n“influence,” or electro-static induction. In Fig. 2 is seen a\\nsimple arrangement for showing this influence or induction.\\nA is a glass ball, and BC a piece of metal, either solid or10\\nhollow, made somewhat in the shape of a sausage, and\\ninsulated by means of its glass support. Three pairs of\\npith balls are suspended from BC as shown. If A is\\nelectrified positively, and brought near BC, the pith balls\\nat B and C repel one another, showing that the ends of\\nBC are electrified. No repulsion takes place between the\\ntwo pith balls at the middle, indicating that this part of\\nBC is not electrified. If the charges at B and C are tested\\nthey are found to be of opposite kinds, that at B being\\nnegative, and that at C positive. Thus it appears that\\nthe positive charge on A has attracted a negative charge\\nto B, and repelled a positive one to C. If A is taken\\naway, the two opposite charges on BC unite and neutralise\\none another, and BC is left in its original uncharged condition,\\nwhile A is found to have lost none of its own charge.\\nIf BC is made in two parts, and if these are separated while\\nunder the influence of A, the two charges cannot unite\\nwhen A is removed, but remain each on its own half of\\nBC. In this experiment A is said to have induced electrification\\non BC. Induction will take place across a considerable\\ndistance, and it is not stopped by the interposition\\nof obstacles such as a sheet of glass.',\n",

One half of the ball is therefore\\nattracted and the other half repelled, but as the attracted\\nhalf is the nearer, the attraction is stronger than the repulsion,\\nand so the ball moves towards the rod.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 3 shows an appliance for obtaining strong charges\\nof electricity by influence or induction. It is called the\\nelectrophorus, the name coming from two Greek words,\\nelectron, amber, and phero,\\nI yield or bear; and it was\\ndevised in 1775 by Volta, an\\nItalian professor of physics.\\nThe apparatus consists of a\\nround cake, A, of some\\nresinous material contained\\nin a metal dish, and a round\\ndisc of metal, B, of slightly\\nsmaller diameter, fitted with\\nan insulating handle. A simple electrophorus may be\\nmade by filling with melted sealing-wax the lid of a\\nround tin, the disc being made of a circular piece of\\ncopper or brass, a little smaller than the lid, fastened to\\nthe end of a stick of sealing-wax. To use the electrophorus,\\nthe sealing-wax is electrified negatively by rubbing\\nit with flannel. The metal disc is then placed on the\\nsealing-wax, touched for an instant with the finger, and\\nlifted away. The disc is now found to be electrified\\npositively, and it may be discharged and the process repeated\\nmany times without recharging the sealing-wax.\\nThe charge on the latter is not used up in the process,12\\nbut it gradually leaks away, and after a time it has to\\nbe renewed.',\n",
       " 'The theory of the electrophorus is easy to understand\\nfrom what we have already learnt about influence. When\\nthe disc B is placed on the charged cake A, the two surfaces\\nare really in contact at only three or four points,\\nbecause neither of them is a true plane; so that on the\\nwhole the disc and the cake are like A and BC in Fig. 2,\\nonly much closer together. The negative charge on\\nA acts by induction\\non the disc B, attracting\\na positive charge\\nto the under side, and\\nrepelling a negative\\ncharge to the upper\\nside. When the disc\\nis touched, the negative\\ncharge on the\\nupper side escapes, but\\nthe positive charge\\nremains, being as it\\nwere held fast by the\\nattraction of the negative\\ncharge on A. If\\nthe disc is now raised, the positive charge is no longer\\nbound on the under side, and it therefore spreads over\\nboth surfaces, remaining there because its escape is cut\\noff by the insulating handle.',\n",
       " 'We may now try to understand the working of influence\\nmachines, which are really mechanically worked electrophori.\\nThere are various types of such machines, but the\\none in most general use in this country is that known as\\nthe Wimshurst machine, Fig. 4, and we will therefore\\nconfine ourselves to this. It consists of two circular plates13\\nof varnished glass or of ebonite, placed close together and\\nso geared that they rotate in opposite directions. On the\\nouter surfaces of the plates are cemented sectors of metal\\nfoil, at equal distances apart. Each plate has the same\\nnumber of sectors, so that at any given moment the sectors\\non one plate are exactly opposite those on the other.\\nAcross the outer surface of each plate is fixed a rod of\\nmetal carrying at its ends light tinsel brushes, which are\\nadjusted to touch the sectors as they pass when the plates\\nare rotated. These rods are placed at an angle to each\\nother of from sixty to ninety degrees, and the brushes are\\ncalled neutralizing brushes. The machine is now complete\\nfor generating purposes, but in order to collect the electricity\\ntwo pairs of insulated metal combs are provided, one pair\\nat each end of the horizontal diameter, with the teeth\\npointing inward towards the plates, but not touching them.\\nThe collecting combs are fitted with adjustable discharging\\nrods terminating in round knobs.',\n",
       " 'The principle upon which the machine works will be\\nbest understood by reference to Fig. 5. In this diagram\\nthe inner circle represents the front plate, with neutralizing\\nbrushes A and B, and the outer one represents the back\\nplate, with brushes C and D. The sectors are shown\\nheavily shaded. E and F are the pairs of combs, and the\\nplates rotate in the direction of the arrows. Let us suppose\\none of the sectors at the top of the back plate to have a\\nslight positive charge. As the plates rotate this sector will\\ncome opposite to a front plate sector touched by brush A,\\nand it will induce a slight negative charge on the latter\\nsector, at the same time repelling a positive charge along\\nthe rod to the sector touched by brush B. The two sectors\\ncarrying the induced charges now move on until opposite\\nback plate sectors touched by brushes C and D, and these\\nback sectors will receive by induction positive and negative14\\ncharges respectively. This process continues as the plates\\nrotate, and finally all the sectors moving towards comb E\\nwill be positively charged, while those approaching comb\\nF will be negatively charged. The combs collect these\\ncharges, and the discharging rods K and L become highly\\nelectrified, K positively and L negatively, and if they are\\nnear enough together sparks will pass between them.',\n",
       " 'At the commencement we supposed one of the sectors\\nto have a positive charge, but it is not necessary to charge\\na sector specially, for the machine is self-starting. Why\\nthis is the case is not yet thoroughly understood, but probably\\nthe explanation is that at any particular moment no\\ntwo places in the atmosphere are in exactly the same15\\nelectro-static condition, so that an uneven state of charge\\nexists permanently amongst the sectors.',\n",
       " 'The Wimshurst machine provides us with a plentiful\\nsupply of electricity, and the question naturally arises,\\n“Can this electricity be stored up in any way?” In 1745,\\nlong before the days of influence machines, a certain Bishop\\nof Pomerania, Von Kleist by name, got the idea that if he\\ncould persuade a charge of electricity to go into a glass\\nbottle he would be able to capture it, because glass was a\\nnon-conductor. So he partly filled a bottle with water, led\\na wire down into the water, and while holding the bottle in\\none hand connected the wire to a primitive form of electric\\nmachine. When he thought he had got enough electricity\\nhe tried to remove his bottle in order to examine the contents,\\nand in so doing he received a shock which scared\\nhim considerably. He had succeeded in storing electricity\\nin his bottle. Shortly afterwards the bishop’s experiment\\nwas repeated by Professor Muschenbrock of Leyden, and\\nby his pupil Cuneus, the former being so startled by the\\nshock that he wrote, “I would not take a second shock for\\nthe kingdom of France.” But in spite of shocks the end\\nwas achieved; it was proved that electricity could be collected\\nand stored up, and the bottle became known as the\\nLeyden jar. The original idea was soon improved upon,\\nwater being replaced by a coating of tinfoil, and it was\\nfound that better results were obtained by coating the\\noutside of the bottle as well as the inside.',\n",
       " 'As now used the Leyden jar consists of a glass jar\\ncovered inside and outside with tinfoil up to about two-thirds\\nof its height. A wooden lid is fitted, through which passes\\na brass rod terminating above in a brass knob, and below\\nin a piece of brass chain long enough to touch the foil\\nlining. A Leyden jar is charged by holding it in one\\nhand with its knob presented to the discharging ball of a16\\nWimshurst machine, and even if the machine is small and\\nfeeble the jar will accumulate electricity until it is very\\nhighly charged. It may now be put down on the table,\\nand if it is clean and quite dry it will hold its charge for\\nsome time. If the outer and inner coatings of the jar are\\nconnected by means of a piece of metal, the electricity will\\nbe discharged in the form of a bright spark. A Leyden\\njar is usually discharged by means of discharging tongs,\\nconsisting of a jointed brass rod with brass terminal\\nknobs and glass handles. One knob is placed in contact\\nwith the outer coating of foil, and the other brought near\\nto the knob of the jar, which of course is connected with\\nthe inner coating.',\n",
       " 'The electrical capacity of even a small Leyden jar is\\nsurprisingly great, and this is due to the mutual attraction\\nbetween opposite kinds of electricity. If we stick a piece\\nof tinfoil on the centre of each face of a pane of glass, and\\ncharge one positively and the other negatively, the two\\ncharges attract each other through the glass; and in fact\\nthey hold on to each other so strongly that we can get very\\nlittle electricity by touching either piece of foil. This\\nmutual attraction enables us to charge the two pieces of\\nfoil much more strongly than if they were each on a\\nseparate pane, and this is the secret of the working of the\\nLeyden jar. If the knob of the jar is held to the positive\\nball of a Wimshurst, the inside coating receives a positive\\ncharge, which acts inductively on the outside coating,\\nattracting a negative charge to the inner face of the latter,\\nand repelling a positive charge to its outer face, and thence\\naway through the hand. The electricity is entirely confined\\nto the sides of the jar, the interior having no charge\\nwhatever.',\n",
       " 'Leyden jars are very often fitted to a Wimshurst\\nmachine as shown at A, A, Fig. 4, and arranged so that they17\\ncan be connected or disconnected to the collecting combs\\nas desired. When the jars are disconnected the machine\\ngives a rapid succession of thin sparks, but when the jars\\nare connected to the combs they accumulate a number of\\ncharges before the discharge takes place, with the result\\nthat the sparks are thicker, but occur at less frequent\\nintervals.',\n",
       " 'It will have been noticed that the rod of a Leyden jar\\nand the discharging rods of a Wimshurst machine are\\nmade to terminate not in points, but in rounded knobs or\\nballs. The reason of this is that electricity rapidly leaks\\naway from points. If we electrify a conductor shaped like\\na cone with a sharp point, the density of the electricity is\\ngreatest at that point, and when it becomes sufficiently\\ngreat the particles of air near the point become electrified\\nand repelled. Other particles take their place, and are\\nelectrified and repelled in the same way, and so a constant\\nloss of electricity takes place. This may be shown in an\\ninteresting way by fastening with wax a needle to the knob\\nof a Wimshurst. If a lighted taper is held to the point of\\nthe needle while the machine is in action, the flame is\\nblown aside by the streams of repelled air, which form a\\nsort of electric wind.',\n",
       " 'If the Leyden jars of a Wimshurst machine are connected\\nup and the discharging balls placed at a suitable distance\\napart, the electricity produced by rotating the plates is\\ndischarged in the form of a brilliant zigzag spark between\\nthe balls, accompanied by a sharp crack. The resemblance\\nbetween this spark and forked lightning is at once evident,\\nand in fact it is lightning in miniature. The discharging\\nballs are charged, as we have seen, with opposite kinds of\\nelectricity, and these charges are constantly trying to reach\\none another across the intervening air, which, being an\\ninsulator, vigorously opposes their passage. There is thus\\na kind of struggle going on between the air and the two\\ncharges of electricity, and this keeps the air in a state of\\nconstant strain. But the resisting power of the air is\\nlimited, and when the charges reach a certain strength the\\nelectricity violently forces its way across, literally rupturing\\nor splitting the air. The particles of air along the path of\\nthe discharge are rendered incandescent by the heat produced\\nby the passage of the electricity, and so the brilliant\\nflash is produced. Just as a river winds about seeking the\\neasiest course, so the electricity takes the path of least\\nresistance, which probably is determined by the particles\\nof dust in the air, and also by the density of the air, which\\nbecomes compressed in front, leaving less dense air and\\ntherefore an easier path on each side.',\n",

       " 'The connexion between lightning and the sparks from\\nelectrified bodies and electrical machines was suspected by\\nmany early observers, but it remained for Benjamin\\nFranklin to prove that lightning was simply a tremendous\\nelectric discharge, by actually obtaining electricity from a\\nthunder-cloud. Franklin was an American, born at Boston\\nin 1706. He was a remarkable man in every way, and\\nquite apart from his investigations in electricity, will always\\nbe remembered for the great public services he rendered to\\nhis country in general and to Philadelphia in particular.\\nHe founded the Philadelphia Library, the American Philosophical\\nSociety, and the University of Pennsylvania.',\n",
       " 'Franklin noticed many similarities between electricity\\nand lightning. For instance, both produced zigzag sparks,\\nboth were conducted by metals, both set fire to inflammable\\nmaterials, and both were capable of killing animals. These\\nresemblances appeared to him so striking that he was\\nconvinced that the two were the same, and he resolved to\\nput the matter to the test. For this purpose he hit upon\\nthe idea of using a kite, to the top of which was fixed a\\npointed wire. At the lower end of the flying string was\\ntied a key, insulated by a piece of silk ribbon. In June\\n1752, Franklin flew his kite, and after waiting a while he\\nwas rewarded by finding that when he brought his knuckle\\nnear to the key a little spark made its appearance. This\\nspark was exactly like the sparks obtained from electrified\\nbodies, but to make things quite certain a Leyden jar was\\ncharged from the key. Various experiments were then\\nperformed with the jar, and it was proved beyond all doubt\\nthat lightning and electricity were one and the same.',\n",
       " 'Lightning is then an enormous electric spark between a\\ncloud and the Earth, or between two clouds, produced when\\nopposite charges become so strong that they are able to\\nbreak down the intervening non-conducting layer of air.20\\nThe surface of the Earth is negatively electrified, the\\nelectrification varying at different times and places; while\\nthe electricity of the air is usually positive, but frequently\\nchanges to negative in rainy weather and on other occasions.\\nAs the clouds float about they collect the electricity from\\nthe air, and thus they may be either positively or negatively\\nelectrified, so that a discharge may take place between one\\ncloud and another, as well as between a cloud and the Earth.',\n",
       " 'Lightning flashes take different forms, the commonest\\nbeing forked or zigzag lightning, and sheet lightning.\\nThe zigzag form is due to the discharge taking the easiest\\npath, as in the case of the spark from a Wimshurst machine.\\nSheet lightning is probably the reflection of a flash taking\\nplace at a distance. It may be unaccompanied by thunder,\\nas in the so-called “summer lightning,” seen on the horizon\\nat night, which is the reflection of a storm too far off for the\\nthunder to be heard. A much rarer form is globular or\\nball lightning, in which the discharge takes the shape of a\\nball of light, which moves slowly along and finally disappears\\nwith a sudden explosion. The cause of this form\\nof lightning is not yet understood, but it is possible that the\\nball of light consists of intensely heated and extremely\\nminute fragments of ordinary matter, torn off by the\\nviolence of the lightning discharge. Another uncommon\\nform is multiple lightning, which consists of a number of\\nseparate parallel discharges having the appearance of a\\nribbon.',\n",
       " 'A lightning flash probably lasts from about 1/100,000 to\\n1/1,000,000 of a second, and in the majority of cases the\\ndischarge is oscillatory; that is to say, it passes several times\\nbackwards and forwards between two clouds or between a\\ncloud and the Earth. At times it appears as though we\\ncould see the lightning start downwards from the cloud or\\nupwards from the Earth, but this is an optical illusion, and21\\nit is really quite impossible to tell at which end the flash\\nstarts.',\n",

This is not the case\\nhowever, for no pain is felt until the impression reaches the\\nbrain by way of the nerves, and this takes an appreciable\\ntime. The nerves transmit sensations at a speed of only\\nabout one hundred feet per second, so that in the case of a\\nman killed by a bullet through the brain, no pain would be\\nfelt, because the brain would be deprived of sensibility\\nbefore the sensation could reach it.

To prevent the audience from being\\nalarmed, I observed that it had often been my desire to\\nreceive accidentally such a shock, and that my wish had at\\nlength been fulfilled.

The cause of the electricity produced by the\\nvoltaic pile was the subject of\\na long and heated controversy.\\nThere were two main theories;\\nthat of Volta himself, which\\nattributed the electricity to the\\nmere contact of unlike metals,\\nand the chemical theory, which\\nascribed it to chemical action.\\nThe chemical theory is now\\ngenerally accepted, but certain\\npoints, into which we need not\\nenter, are still in dispute.',\n",
       " 'There is a curious experiment\\nwhich some of my readers\\nmay like to try. Place a copper\\ncoin on a sheet of zinc, and set an\\nordinary garden snail to crawl\\nacross the zinc towards the coin. As soon as the snail\\ncomes in contact with the copper it shrinks back, and shows\\nevery sign of having received a shock. One can well\\nimagine that an enthusiastic gardener pestered with snails\\nwould watch this experiment with great glee.',\n",
       " 'Volta soon found that it was not necessary to have his\\npairs of metals in actual metallic contact, and that better\\nresults were got by placing them in a vessel filled with\\ndilute acid. Fig. 7 is a diagram of a simple voltaic cell of30\\nthis kind, and it shows the direction of the current when\\nthe zinc and the copper are connected by the wire. In\\norder to get some idea of the reason why a current flows\\nwe must understand the meaning of electric potential. If\\nwater is poured into a vessel, a certain water pressure is\\nproduced. The amount of this pressure depends upon the\\nlevel of the water, and this in turn depends upon the\\nquantity of water and the capacity of the vessel, for a\\ngiven quantity of water will reach a higher level in a small\\nvessel than in a larger one. In the same way, if electricity\\nis imparted to a conductor an electric pressure is\\nproduced, its amount depending upon the quantity of\\nelectricity and the electric capacity of the conductor, for\\nconductors vary in capacity just as water vessels do.',\n",
       " 'This electric pressure is called “potential,” and electricity\\ntends to flow from a conductor of higher to one of lower\\npotential. When we say that a place is so many feet\\nabove or below sea-level we are using the level of the sea\\nas a zero level, and in estimating electric potential we take\\nthe potential of the earth’s surface as zero; and we regard\\na positively electrified body as one at a positive or relatively\\nhigh potential, and a negatively electrified body as\\none at a negative or relatively low potential. This may be\\nclearer if we think of temperature and the thermometer.\\nTemperatures above zero are positive and represented by\\nthe sign +, and those below zero are negative and represented\\nby the sign -. Thus we assume that an electric\\ncurrent flows from a positive to a negative conductor.',\n",
       " 'In a voltaic cell the plates are at different potentials, so\\nthat when they are connected by a wire a current flows,\\nand we say that the current leaves the cell at the positive\\nterminal, and enters it again at the negative terminal. As\\nshown in Fig. 7, the current moves in opposite directions\\ninside and outside the cell, making a complete round called\\na circuit, and if the circuit is broken anywhere the current\\nceases to flow. If the circuit is complete the current keeps\\non flowing, trying to equalize the electric pressure or\\npotential, but it is unable to do this because the chemical\\naction between the acid and the zinc maintains the difference\\nof potential between the plates. This chemical action\\nresults in wasting of the zinc and weakening of the acid,\\nand as long as it continues the current keeps on flowing.\\nWhen we wish to stop the current we break the circuit by\\ndisconnecting the wire joining the terminals, and the cell\\nthen should be at rest; but owing to the impurities in\\nordinary commercial zinc chemical action still continues.\\nIn order to prevent wasting when the current is not required\\nthe surface of the zinc is coated with a thin film of\\nmercury. The zinc is then said to be amalgamated, and\\nit is not acted upon by the acid so long as the circuit\\nremains broken.',\n",
       " 'The current from a simple voltaic cell does not remain\\nat a constant strength, but after a short time it begins to\\nweaken rapidly. The cell is then said to be polarized, and\\nthis polarization is caused by bubbles of hydrogen gas\\nwhich accumulate on the surface of the copper plate during\\nthe chemical action. These bubbles of gas weaken the\\ncurrent partly by resisting its flow, for they are bad conductors,\\nand still more by trying to set up another current\\nin the opposite direction. For this reason the simple\\nvoltaic cell is unsuitable for long spells of work, and many\\ncells have been devised to avoid the polarization trouble.\\nOne of the most successful of these is the Daniell cell. It\\nconsists of an outer vessel of copper, which serves as the\\ncopper plate, and an inner porous pot containing a zinc\\nrod. Dilute sulphuric acid is put into the porous pot and\\na strong solution of copper sulphate into the outer jar.\\nWhen the circuit is closed, the hydrogen liberated by the32\\naction of the zinc on the acid passes through the porous\\npot, and splits up the copper sulphate into copper and\\nsulphuric acid. In this way pure copper, instead of\\nhydrogen, is deposited on the copper plate, no polarization\\ntakes place, and the current is constant.',\n",
       " 'Other cells have different combinations of metals, such\\nas silver-zinc, or platinum-zinc, and carbon is also largely\\nused in place of one metal, as in the familiar carbon-zinc\\nLeclanché cell, used for ringing electric bells. This cell\\nconsists of an inner porous pot containing a carbon plate\\npacked round with a mixture of crushed carbon and manganese\\ndioxide, and an outer glass jar containing a zinc\\nrod and a solution of sal-ammoniac. Polarization is\\nchecked by the oxygen in the manganese dioxide, which\\nseizes the hydrogen on its way to the carbon plate, and\\ncombines with it. If the cell is used continuously however\\nthis action cannot keep pace with the rate at which the\\nhydrogen is produced, and so the cell becomes polarized;\\nbut it soon recovers after a short rest.',\n",

Dry cells are placed inside closely fitting cardboard\\ntubes, and are sealed up at the top. Their chief advantage\\nlies in their portability, for as there is no free liquid to\\nspill they can be carried about and placed in any position.',\n",
       " 'We have seen that the continuance of the current from\\na voltaic cell depends upon the keeping up of a difference\\nof potential between the plates. The force which serves\\nto maintain this difference is called the electro-motive force,\\nand it is measured in volts. The actual flow of electricity33\\nis measured in amperes. Probably all my readers are\\nfamiliar with the terms volt and ampere, but perhaps some\\nmay not be quite clear about the distinction between the\\ntwo. When water flows along a pipe we know that it is\\nbeing forced to do so by pressure resulting from a difference\\nof level. That is to say, a difference of level produces\\na water-moving or water-motive force; and in a\\nsimilar way a difference of potential produces an electricity-moving\\nor electro-motive force, which is measured\\nin volts. If we wish to describe the rate of flow of water\\nwe state it in gallons per second, and the rate of flow of\\nelectricity is stated in amperes. Volts thus represent the\\npressure at which a current is supplied, while the current\\nitself is measured in amperes.',\n",
       " 'We may take this opportunity of speaking of electric\\nresistance. A current of water flowing through a pipe is\\nresisted by friction against the inner surface of the pipe;\\nand a current of electricity flowing through a circuit also\\nmeets with a resistance, though this is not due to friction.\\nIn a good conductor this resistance is small, but in a bad\\nconductor or non-conductor it is very great. The resistance\\nalso depends upon length and area of cross-section; so that\\na long wire offers more resistance than a short one, and a\\nthin wire more than a thick one. Before any current can\\nflow in a circuit the electro-motive force must overcome\\nthe resistance, and we might say that the volts drive the\\namperes through the resistance. The unit of resistance is\\nthe ohm, and the definition of a volt is that electro-motive\\nforce which will cause a current of one ampere to flow\\nthrough a conductor having a resistance of one ohm. These\\nunits of measurement are named after three famous scientists,\\nVolta, Ampère, and Ohm.',\n",
       " 'A number of cells coupled together form a battery, and\\ndifferent methods of coupling are used to get different34\\nresults. In addition to the resistance of the circuit outside\\nthe cell, the cell itself offers an internal resistance, and part\\nof the electro-motive force is used up in overcoming this\\nresistance. If we can decrease this internal resistance we\\nshall have a larger current at our disposal, and one way of\\ndoing this is to increase the size of the plates. This of\\ncourse means making the cell larger, and very large cells\\ntake up a lot of room and are troublesome to move about.\\nWe can get the same effect however by coupling. If we\\nconnect together all the positive terminals and all the\\nnegative terminals of several cells, that is, copper to copper\\nand zinc to zinc in Daniell cells, we get the same result as\\nif we had one very large cell. The current is much larger,\\nbut the electro-motive force remains the same as if only\\none cell were used, or in other words we have more amperes\\nbut no more volts. This is called connecting in “parallel,”\\nand the method is shown in Fig. 8. On the other hand,\\nif, as is usually the case, we want a larger electro-motive\\nforce, we connect the positive terminal of one cell to the\\nnegative terminal of the next, or copper to zinc all through.\\nIn this way we add together the electro-motive forces of all\\nthe cells, but the amount of current remains that of a single\\ncell; that is, we get more volts but no more amperes. This is\\ncalled connecting in “series,” and the arrangement is shown35\\nin Fig. 9. We can also increase both volts and amperes by\\ncombining the two methods.',\n",
       " 'A voltaic cell gives us a considerable quantity of\\nelectricity at low pressure, the electro-motive force of a\\nLeclanché cell being about 1½ volts, and that of a Daniell\\ncell about 1 volt. We may perhaps get some idea of the\\nelectrical conditions existing during a thunderstorm from\\nthe fact that to produce a spark one mile long through air\\nat ordinary pressure we should require a battery of more\\nthan a thousand million Daniell cells. Cells such as we\\nhave described in this chapter are called primary cells, as\\ndistinguished from accumulators, which are called secondary\\ncells.

       " 'Besides the voltaic cell, in which the current is produced\\nby chemical action, there is the thermo-electric battery, or\\nthermopile, which produces current directly from heat\\nenergy. About 1822 Seebeck was experimenting with\\nvoltaic pairs of metals, and he found that a current could\\nbe produced in a complete metallic circuit consisting of\\ndifferent metals joined together, by keeping these joinings\\nat different temperatures. Fig. 10 shows a simple arrangement\\nfor demonstrating this effect, which is known as the36\\n“Seebeck effect.” A slab of bismuth, BB, has placed upon it\\na bent strip of copper, C. If one of the junctions of the\\ntwo metals is heated as shown, a current flows; and the\\nsame effect is produced\\nby cooling one of the\\njunctions. This current\\ncontinues to flow\\nas long as the two junctions\\nare kept at different\\ntemperatures. In\\n1834 another scientist,\\nPeltier, discovered that\\nif a current was passed\\nacross a junction of two different metals, this junction was\\neither heated or cooled, according to the direction in which\\nthe current flowed. In Fig. 10 the current across the\\nheated junction tends to cool the junction, while the Bunsen\\nburner opposes this cooling, and keeps up the temperature.\\nA certain amount of the heat energy is thus transformed\\ninto electrical\\nenergy. At the\\nother junction\\nthe current\\nproduces a\\nheating effect,\\nso that some of\\nthe electrical\\nenergy is retransformed\\ninto heat.',\n",

The arrangement is such\\nthat the odd junctions are at one side, and the even ones37\\nat the other. The odd junctions are heated, and the even\\nones cooled, and a current flows when the circuit is completed.\\nBy using a larger number of junctions, and by\\nincreasing the difference of temperature between them, the\\nvoltage of the current may be increased. Thermopiles are\\nnothing like so efficient as voltaic cells, and they are more\\ncostly. They are used to a limited extent for purposes\\nrequiring a very small and constant current, but for\\ngenerating considerable quantities of current at high\\npressure they are quite useless. The only really important\\npractical use of the thermopile is in the detection and\\nmeasurement of very minute differences of temperature,\\nwhich are beyond the capabilities of the ordinary thermometer.\\nWithin certain limits, the electro-motive force of a\\nthermopile is exactly proportionate to the difference of\\ntemperature. The very slightest difference of temperature\\nproduces a current, and by connecting the wires from a\\nspecially constructed thermopile to a delicate instrument\\nfor measuring the strength of the current, temperature\\ndifferences of less than one-millionth of a degree can be\\ndetected.',\n",
       " 'If we had two large water tanks, one of which could be\\nemptied only by allowing the bottom to fall completely out,\\nand the other by means of a narrow pipe, it is easy to see\\nwhich would be the more useful to us as a source of water\\nsupply.

The Leyden jar stores\\nelectricity, but in yielding up its store it acts like the first\\ntank, giving a sudden discharge in the form of a bright\\nspark. We cannot control the discharge, and therefore we\\ncannot make it do useful work for us. For practical\\npurposes we require a storing arrangement that will act like\\nthe second tank, giving us a steady current of electricity\\nfor a long period, and this we have in the accumulator or\\nstorage cell.',\n",
       " 'A current of electricity has the power of decomposing\\ncertain liquids. If we pass a current through water, the\\nwater is split up into its two constituent gases, hydrogen\\nand oxygen, and this may be shown by the apparatus seen\\nin Fig. 12. It consists of a glass vessel with two strips of\\nplatinum to which the current is led. The vessel contains\\nwater to which has been added a little sulphuric acid to\\nincrease its conducting power, and over the strips are inverted\\ntwo test-tubes filled with the acidulated water.

In the present\\ncase a similar opposing or back electro-motive force is\\nproduced, and as soon as the battery current is stopped\\nand the electrodes are connected, we get a current in the\\nreverse direction, and this current continues to flow until\\nthe two gases have recombined, and the electrodes have\\nregained their original condition. Consequently we can\\nsee that in order to electrolyze water, our battery must\\nhave an electro-motive force greater than that set up in\\nopposition to it, and at least two Daniell cells are required.',\n",

This is a rough-and-ready way of putting the\\nmatter, but it is good enough for practical purposes, and at\\nany rate it makes it quite clear that what an accumulator\\nreally stores up is not electricity, but energy, which is given\\nout in the form of electricity.',\n",
       " 'The apparatus just described is of little use as a source\\nof current, and the first really practical accumulator was\\nmade in 1878 by Gaston Planté. The electrodes were two\\nstrips of sheet lead placed one upon the other, but separated\\nby some insulating material, and made into a roll. This\\nroll was placed in dilute sulphuric acid, and one strip or\\nplate connected to the positive, and the other to the\\nnegative terminal of the source of current. The current\\nwas passed for a certain length of time, and then the accumulator\\npartly discharged; after which current was passed\\nagain, but in the reverse direction, followed by another period\\nof discharge. This process, which is called forming,\\nwas continued for several days, and its effect was to change\\none plate into a spongy condition, and to form a coating\\nof peroxide of lead on the other. When the plates were\\nproperly formed the accumulator was ready to be fully\\ncharged and put into use. The effect of charging was to\\nrob one plate of its oxygen, and to transfer this oxygen to\\nthe other plate, which thus received an overcharge of the\\ngas. During the discharge of the accumulator the excess\\nof oxygen went back to the place from which it had been\\ntaken, and the current continued until the surfaces of both41\\nplates were reduced to a chemically inactive state. The\\naccumulator could be charged and discharged over and\\nover again as long as the plates remained in good order.',\n",
       " 'In 1881, Faure hit upon the idea of coating the plates\\nwith a paste of red-lead, and this greatly shortened the\\ntime of forming. At first it was found difficult to make the\\npaste stick to the plates, but this trouble was got rid of by\\nmaking the plates in the form of grids, and pressing the\\npaste into the perforations. Many further improvements\\nhave been made from time to time, but instead of tracing\\nthese we will go on at once to the description of a present-day\\naccumulator. There are now many excellent accumulators\\nmade, but we have not space to consider more than\\none, and we will select that known as the “Chloride”\\naccumulator.',\n",
       " 'The positive plate of this accumulator is of the Planté\\ntype, but it is not simply a casting of pure lead, but is made\\nby a building-up process which allows of the use of a\\nlead-antimony mixture for the grids. This gives greater\\nstrength, and the grids themselves are unaffected by the\\nchemical changes which take place during the charging and\\ndischarging of the cell. The active material, that is the\\nmaterial which undergoes chemical change, is pure lead\\ntape coiled up into rosettes, which are so designed that the\\nacid can circulate through the plates. These rosettes are\\ndriven into the perforations of the grid by a hydraulic press,\\nand during the process of forming they expand and thus\\nbecome very firmly fixed. The negative plate has a frame\\nmade in two parts, which are riveted together after the\\ninsertion of the active material, which is thus contained in\\na number of small cages. The plate is covered outside\\nwith a finely perforated sheet of lead, which prevents the\\nactive material from falling out. It is of the utmost\\nimportance that the positive and negative plates should be42\\nkept apart when in the cell, and in the Chloride accumulator\\nthis is ensured by the use of a patent separator made of\\na thin sheet of wood the size of the plates. Before being\\nused the wood undergoes a special treatment to remove all\\nsubstances which might be harmful, and it then remains\\nunchanged either in appearance or composition. Other\\ninsulating substances, such as glass rods or ebonite forks,\\ncan be used as separators, but it is claimed that the wood\\nseparator is not only more satisfactory, but that in some\\nunexplained way it actually helps to keep up the capacity\\nof the cell. The plates are placed in glass, or lead-lined\\nwood or metal boxes, and are suspended from above the\\ndilute sulphuric acid with which the cells are filled. A\\nspace is left below the plates for the sediment which\\naccumulates during the working of the cell.',\n",
       " 'In all but the smallest cells several pairs of plates are\\nused, all the positive plates being connected together and\\nall the negative plates. This gives the same effect as two\\nvery large plates, on the principle of connecting in parallel,\\nspoken of in Chapter IV. A single cell, of whatever size,\\ngives current at about two volts, and to get higher voltages\\nmany cells are connected in series, as with primary cells.\\nThe capacity is generally measured in ampere-hours. For\\ninstance, an accumulator that will give a current of eight\\namperes for one hour, or of four amperes for two hours, or\\none ampere for eight hours, is said to have a capacity of\\neight ampere-hours.',\n",
       " 'Accumulators are usually charged from a dynamo or\\nfrom the public mains, and the electro-motive force of\\nthe charging current must be not less than 2½ volts for\\neach cell, in order to overcome the back electro-motive\\nforce of the cells themselves.

If a layer of iron filings is spread on a\\nsheet of paper, and a magnet brought gradually nearer\\nfrom above, the filings soon begin to move about restlessly,\\nand when the magnet comes close enough they fly up to it\\nas if pulled by invisible strings. A still more striking49\\nexperiment consists in spreading filings thinly over a sheet\\nof cardboard and moving a magnet to and fro underneath\\nthe sheet. The result is most amusing. The filings seem\\nto stand up on their hind legs, and they march about like\\nregiments of soldiers. Here again invisible strings are\\nsuggested, and we might wonder whether there really is\\nanything of the kind. Yes, there is. To put the matter\\nin the simplest way, the magnet acts by means of strings\\nor lines of force, which emerge from it in definite directions,\\nand in a most interesting way we can see some of these\\nlines of force actually at work.',\n",
       " 'Place a magnet, or any arrangement of magnets, underneath\\na sheet of glass, and sprinkle iron filings from a\\nmuslin bag thinly and evenly all over the glass. Then tap\\nthe glass gently with a pencil, and the filings at once\\narrange themselves in a most remarkable manner. All the\\nfilings become magnetized by induction, and when the tap\\nsets them free for an instant from the friction of the glass\\nthey take up definite positions under the influence of the\\nforce acting upon them. In this way we get a map of\\nthe general direction of the magnetic lines of force, which\\nare our invisible strings.',\n",
       " 'Many different maps may be made in this way, but we\\nhave space for only two. Plate III.a shows the lines of two\\nopposite poles. Notice how they appear to stream across\\nfrom one pole to the other. It is believed that there is a\\ntension along the lines of force not unlike that in stretched\\nelastic bands, and if this is so it is easy to see from the\\nfigure why opposite poles attract each other.',\n",
       " 'Plate III.b shows the lines of force of two similar poles.\\nIn this case they do not stream from pole to pole, but turn\\naside as if repelling one another, and from this figure we\\nsee why there is repulsion between two similar poles. It\\ncan be shown, although in a much less simple manner, that50\\nlines of electric force proceed from electrified bodies, and\\nin electric attraction and repulsion between two charged\\nbodies the lines of force take paths which closely resemble\\nthose in our two figures. A space filled with lines of\\nmagnetic force is called a magnetic field, and one filled\\nwith lines of electric force is called an electric field.',\n",
       " 'A horse-shoe magnet, which is simply a bar of steel\\nbent into the shape of a horse-shoe before being magnetized,\\ngradually loses its magnetism if left with its poles\\nunprotected, but this loss is prevented if the poles are\\nconnected by a piece of soft iron. The same loss occurs\\nwith a bar magnet, but as the two poles cannot be connected\\nin this way it is customary to keep two bar magnets side\\nby side, separated by a strip of wood; with opposite poles\\ntogether and a piece of soft iron across the ends. Such\\npieces of iron are called keepers, and Fig. 13 shows a\\nhorse-shoe magnet and a pair of bar magnets with their\\nkeepers. It may be remarked that a magnet never should\\nbe knocked or allowed to fall, as rough usage of this kind\\ncauses it to lose a considerable amount of its magnetism.\\nA magnet is injured also by allowing the keeper to slam on\\nto it; but pulling the keeper off vigorously does good\\ninstead of harm.',\n",
       " 'If a magnetized needle is suspended so that it is free to\\nswing either horizontally or vertically, it not only comes\\nto rest in a north and south direction, but also it tilts with\\nits north-pointing end downwards. If the needle were\\ntaken to a place south of the equator it would still tilt, but\\nthe south-pointing end would be downwards. In both\\ncases the angle the needle makes with the horizontal is\\ncalled the magnetic dip.',\n",
       " 'It is evident that a suspended magnetized needle would\\nnot invariably come to rest pointing north and south unless\\nit were compelled to do so, and a little consideration shows51\\nthat the needle acts as if it were under the influence of a\\nmagnet. Dr. Gilbert of Colchester, of whom we spoke in\\nChapter I., gave a great deal of time to the study of\\nmagnetic phenomena, and in 1600 he announced what may\\nbe regarded as his greatest discovery: The terrestrial\\nglobe itself is a great magnet. Here, then, is the explanation\\nof the behaviour of the magnetized needle. The Earth\\nitself is a great magnet, having its poles near to the\\ngeographical north and south poles. But a question at\\nonce suggests itself: “Since similar poles repel one another,\\nhow is it that the north pole of a magnet turns towards the\\nnorth magnetic pole of the earth?” This apparent difficulty\\nis caused by a confusion in terms. If the Earth’s\\nnorth magnetic pole really has north magnetism, then the\\nnorth-pointing end of a magnet must be a south pole; and\\non the other hand, if the north-pointing end of a magnet\\nhas north magnetism, then the Earth’s north magnetic pole\\nmust be really a south pole. It is a troublesome matter to\\nsettle, but it is now customary to regard the Earth’s north\\nmagnetic pole as possessing south magnetism, and the\\nsouth magnetic pole as possessing north magnetism. In\\nthis way the north-pointing pole of a magnet may be looked\\nupon as a true north pole, and the south-pointing pole as a\\ntrue south pole.',\n",
       " 'Magnetic dip also is seen to be a natural result of the\\nEarth’s magnetic influence. Here in England, for instance,\\nthe north magnetic pole is much nearer than the south\\nmagnetic pole, and consequently its influence is the\\nstronger. Therefore a magnetized needle, if free to do\\nso, dips downwards towards the north. At any place\\nwhere the south magnetic pole is the nearer the direction\\nof the dip of course is reversed. If placed immediately\\nover either magnetic pole the needle would take up a\\nvertical position, and at the magnetic equator it would not52\\ndip at all, for the influence of the two magnetic poles would\\nbe equal. A little study of Fig. 14, which represents a\\ndipping needle at different parts of the earth, will make\\nthis matter clearer. N and S represent the Earth’s north\\nand south magnetic poles, and the arrow heads are the\\nnorth poles of the needles.',\n",
       " 'Since the Earth is a magnet, we should expect it to\\nbe able to induce magnetism in a bar of iron, just as our\\nartificial magnets do, and we can show that this is actually\\nthe case. If a steel poker is held pointing to and dipping\\ndown towards the\\nnorth, and struck\\nsharply with a piece\\nof wood while in this\\nposition, it acquires\\nmagnetic properties\\nwhich can be tested\\nby means of a small\\ncompass needle. It\\nis an interesting fact\\nthat iron pillars and\\nrailings which have\\nbeen standing for a\\nlong time in one position are found to be magnetized.\\nIn the northern hemisphere the bases of upright iron\\npillars are north poles, and their upper ends south poles,\\nand in the southern hemisphere the polarity is reversed.',\n",

An ordinary pocket compass for inland\\nuse consists simply of a single magnetized needle pivoted\\nso as to swing freely over a card on which are marked the\\nthirty-two points of the compass. Ships’ compasses are\\nmuch more elaborate. As a rule a compound needle is\\nused, consisting of eight slender strips of steel, magnetized53\\nseparately, and suspended side by side. A compound\\nneedle of this kind is very much more reliable than a\\nsingle needle. The material of which the card is made\\ndepends upon whether the illumination for night work is\\nto come from above or below. If the latter, the card must\\nbe transparent, and it is often made of thin sheet mica;\\nbut if the light comes from above, the card is made of\\nsome opaque material, such as very stout paper. The\\nneedle and card are contained in a sort of bowl made of\\ncopper. In order to keep this bowl in a horizontal position,\\nhowever the ship may be pitching and rolling, it is supported\\non gimbals, which are two concentric rings attached\\nto horizontal pivots, and moving in axes at right angles\\nto one another. Further stability may be obtained by\\nweighting the bottom of the bowl with lead. There are\\nalso liquid compasses, in which the card is floated on the\\nsurface of dilute alcohol, and many modern ships’ compasses\\nhave their movements regulated by a gyrostat.',\n",
       " 'The large amount of iron and steel used in the construction\\nof modern vessels has a considerable effect upon\\nthe compass needle, and unless the compass is protected\\nfrom this influence its readings are liable to serious errors.\\nThe most satisfactory way of giving this protection is by\\nplacing on each side of the compass a large globe of soft\\niron, twelve or more inches in diameter.',\n",
       " 'On account of the fact that the magnetic poles of the\\nEarth do not coincide with the geographical north and\\nsouth poles, a compass needle seldom points exactly north\\nand south, and the angle between the magnetic meridian\\nand the geographical meridian is called the declination.\\nThe discovery that the declination varies in different parts\\nof the world was made by Columbus in 1492. For purposes\\nof navigation it is obviously very important that the\\ndeclination at all points of the Earth’s surface should be54\\nknown, and special magnetic maps are prepared in which\\nall places having the same declination are joined by a\\nline.',\n",

Small doses of lodestone,\\nground to powder and mixed with water, were supposed\\nto prolong life, and Paracelsus, a famous alchemist and\\nphysician, born in Switzerland in 1493, believed in the\\npotency of lodestone ointment for wounds made with steel\\nweapons. Baron Reichenbach, 1788–1860, believed that\\nhe had discovered the existence of a peculiar physical force\\nclosely connected with magnetism, and he gave this force\\nthe name Od. It was supposed to exist everywhere,\\nand, like magnetism, to have two poles, positive and\\nnegative; the left side of the body being od-positive, and\\nthe right side od-negative. Certain individuals, known as\\n“sensitives,” were said to be specially open to its influence.\\nThese people stated that they saw strange flickering lights\\nat the poles of magnets, and that they experienced peculiar\\nsensations when a magnet was passed over them. Some\\nof them indeed were unable to sleep on the left side, because\\nthe north pole of the Earth, being od-negative, had\\na bad effect on the od-negative left side. The pretended\\nrevelations of these “sensitives” created a great stir at the\\ntime, but now nobody believes in the existence of Od.',\n",

In the\\nyear 1819 Professor Oersted, of the University of Copenhagen,\\ndiscovered that a freely swinging magnetized needle,\\nsuch as a compass needle, was deflected by a current of\\nelectricity flowing through a wire. In Fig. 15, A, a\\nmagnetic needle is shown at rest in its usual north and\\nsouth direction, and over it is held a copper wire, also\\npointing north and south. A current of electricity is now\\nsent through the wire, and the needle is at once deflected,\\nFig. 15, B. The direction of the current is indicated by57\\nan arrow, and the direction in which the needle has moved\\nis shown by the two small arrows. If the direction of the\\ncurrent is reversed, the needle will be deflected in the\\nopposite direction. From this experiment we see that the\\ncurrent has brought magnetic influences into play, or in\\nother words has produced magnetism. If iron filings are\\nbrought near the wire while the current is flowing, they\\nare at once attracted and cling to the wire, but as soon as\\nthe current is stopped\\nthey drop off. This\\nshows us that the wire\\nitself becomes a magnet\\nduring the passage of\\nthe current, and that it\\nloses its magnetism\\nwhen the current ceases\\nto flow.',\n",

Fig. 16\\nshows the direction of the lines of force of a wire conveying\\na current and passed through a horizontal piece of cardboard\\ncovered with a thin layer of iron filings; and from this\\nfigure it is evident that the passage of the current produces\\nwhat we may call magnetic whirls round the wire.',\n",

Solenoids have various practical applications, and in\\nlater chapters we shall refer to them again.',\n",
       " 'If several turns of cotton-covered wire are wound round\\nan iron rod, the passing of a current through the wire\\nmakes the rod into a magnet (Plate II.b), but the magnetism\\ndisappears as soon as the current ceases to flow. A\\nmagnet made by the passage of an electric current is called\\nan electro-magnet, and it has all the properties of the\\nmagnets mentioned in the previous chapter. A bar of steel\\nmay be magnetized in the same way, but unlike the iron\\nrod it retains its magnetism after the current is interrupted.\\nThis provides us with a means of magnetizing a piece of\\nsteel much more strongly than is possible by rubbing with\\nanother magnet.

In large engineering\\nworks powerful electro-magnets, suspended from some\\nsort of travelling crane, are most useful for picking up and\\ncarrying about heavy masses of metal, such as large59\\ncastings. No time is lost in attaching the casting to the\\ncrane; the magnet picks it up directly the current is\\nswitched on, and lets it go the instant the current is\\nstopped. In any large steel works the amount of scrap\\nmaterial produced is astonishingly great, hundreds of tons\\nof turnings and similar scrap accumulating in a very short\\ntime.

This is called a galvanometer,\\nand in its simplest form it consists essentially of\\na delicately poised magnetic needle placed in the middle of\\na coil of several turns of wire. The current thus passes\\nmany times round the needle, and this has the effect of\\ngreatly increasing the deflection of the needle, and hence\\nthe sensitiveness of the instrument.

Such a galvanometer, fitted with a carefully\\ngraduated scale, in this way will indicate the number of\\nvolts, and it is called a voltmeter. If we have a galvanometer\\nwith a short coil of very thick wire, the resistance put\\nin the way of the current is so small that it may be left out\\nof account, and by means of a graduated scale the number\\nof amperes may be shown; such an instrument being called\\nan amperemeter, or ammeter.',\n",

Just as an electrified body and a\\nmagnet will induce electrification and magnetism respectively,\\nso a current of electricity will induce another current;\\nand an induction coil is simply an arrangement by which a\\ncurrent in one coil of wire is made to induce a current in\\nanother coil.',\n",

So long as we keep the\\ncurrent flowing through the first coil the galvanometer\\nshows no further movement, but as soon as we stop the\\ncurrent the needle again shows by its movements that\\nanother momentary current has been produced in the\\nsecond coil. This experiment shows us that a current62\\ninduces another current only at the instant it is started or\\nstopped, or, as we say, at the instant of making or breaking\\nthe circuit.',\n",
       " 'The coil through which we send the battery current is\\ncalled the “primary coil,” and the one in which a current is\\ninduced is called the “secondary coil.” The two momentary\\ncurrents in the secondary coil do not both flow in the same\\ndirection. The current induced on making the circuit\\nflows in a direction opposite to that of the current in the\\nprimary coil; and the current induced on breaking the\\ncircuit flows in the same direction as that in the primary\\ncoil. If the two coils are exactly alike, the induced current\\nwill have the same voltage as the primary current; but\\nif the secondary coil has twice as many turns of wire\\nas the primary coil, the induced current will have twice\\nthe voltage of the primary current.

       " 'By means of a large induction coil we can obtain a\\nvoltage hundreds or even thousands of times greater than\\nthat of the original battery current, but on account of the\\ngreat resistance of a very long, thin wire, the amperage is\\nmuch smaller.

       " 'Oersted’s discovery of the production of magnetism by\\nelectricity naturally suggested the possibility of producing\\nelectricity from magnetism. In the year 1831 one of the\\nmost brilliant of our British scientists, Michael Faraday,\\ndiscovered that a current of electricity could be induced in\\na coil of wire either by moving the coil towards or away\\nfrom a magnet, or by moving a magnet towards or away\\nfrom the coil. This may be shown in a simple way by\\nconnecting the ends of a coil of insulated wire to a galvanometer,67\\nand moving a bar magnet in and out of the coil;\\nwhen the galvanometer shows that a current is induced in\\nthe coil on the insertion of the magnet, and again on its\\nwithdrawal. We have seen that a magnet is surrounded\\nby a field of magnetic force, and Faraday found that the\\ncurrent was induced when the lines of force were cut across.',\n",
       " 'Utilizing this discovery Faraday constructed the first\\ndynamo, which consisted of a copper plate or disc rotated\\nbetween the poles of a powerful horse-shoe magnet, so as\\nto cut the lines of force. The current flowed either from\\nthe shaft to the rim, or vice versa, according to the direction\\nof rotation; and it was conducted away by means of two\\nwires with spring contacts, one pressing against the shaft,\\nand the other against the circumference of the disc. This\\nmachine was miserably inefficient, but it was the very first\\ndynamo, and from it have been slowly evolved the mighty\\ndynamos used to-day in electric power stations throughout\\nthe world. There is a little story told of Faraday\\nwhich is worth repeating even if it is not true. Speaking\\nof his discovery that a magnet could be made to produce\\nan electric current, a lady once said to him, “This is all\\nvery interesting, but what is the use of it?” “Madam,”\\nreplied Faraday, “what is the use of a baby?” In\\nFaraday’s “baby” dynamo, as in all others, some kind of\\npower must be used to produce the necessary motion, so\\nthat all dynamos are really machines for converting\\nmechanical energy into electrical energy.',\n",
       " 'The copper disc in this first dynamo did not prove\\nsatisfactory, and Faraday soon substituted for it rotating\\ncoils of wire. In 1832 a dynamo was constructed in which\\na length of insulated wire was wound upon two bobbins\\nhaving soft iron cores, and a powerful horse-shoe magnet\\nwas fixed to a rotating spindle in such a position that its\\npoles faced the cores of the bobbins. This machine gave68\\na fair current, but it was found that the magnet gradually\\nlost its magnetism on account of the vibration caused by\\nits rotation. The next step was to make the magnet a\\nfixture, and to rotate the bobbins of wire. This was a\\ngreat improvement, and the power of machines built on\\nthis principle was much increased by having a number of\\nrotating coils and several magnets. One such machine\\nhad 64 separate\\ncoils rotating\\nbetween the\\npoles of 40 large\\nmagnets. Finally,\\npermanent\\nmagnets were\\nsuperseded by\\nelectro-magnets,\\nwhich\\ngave a much\\nmore powerful\\nfield of force.',\n",

Fig. 19 is a\\nrough representation of a dynamo in its simplest form. The\\ntwo poles of the magnet are shown marked north and south,\\nand between them revolves the coil of wire A¹ A², mounted\\non a spindle SS. This revolving coil is called the armature.\\nTo each of the insulated rings RR is fixed one end of the\\ncoil, and BB are two brushes of copper or carbon, one\\npressing on each ring. From these brushes the current is69\\nled away into the main circuit, and in this case we may\\nsuppose that the current is used to light a lamp.',\n",
       " 'In speaking of the induction coil we saw that the\\ncurrents induced on making and on breaking the circuit\\nflowed in opposite directions, and similarly, Faraday found\\nthat the currents induced in a coil of wire on inserting and\\non withdrawing his magnet flowed in opposite directions.\\nIn the present case the magnet is stationary and the coil\\nmoves, but the effect is just the same. Now if we suppose\\nthe armature to be revolving in a clockwise direction, then\\nA¹ is descending and entering the magnetic field in front of\\nthe north pole, consequently a current is induced in the\\ncoil, and of course in the main circuit also, in one direction.\\nContinuing its course, A¹ passes away from this portion of\\nthe magnetic field, and thus a current is induced in the\\nopposite direction. In this way we get a current which\\nreverses its direction every half-revolution, and such a\\ncurrent is called an alternating current. If, as in our\\ndiagram, there are only two magnetic poles, the current\\nflows backwards and forwards once every revolution, but\\nby using a number of magnets, arranged so that the coil\\npasses in turn the poles of each, it can be made to flow\\nbackwards and forwards several times. One complete\\nflow backwards and forwards is called a period, and the\\nnumber of periods per second is called the periodicity or\\nfrequency of the current. A dynamo with one coil or set\\nof coils gives what is called “single-phase” current, that is, a\\ncurrent having one wave which keeps flowing backwards\\nand forwards. If there are two distinct sets of coils we get\\na two-phase current, in which there are two separate waves,\\none rising as the other falls. Similarly, by using more\\nsets of coils, we may obtain three-phase or polyphase\\ncurrents.',\n",

       " 'In actual practice a dynamo has a set of electro-magnets,\\nand the armature consists of many coils of wire mounted\\non a core of iron, which has the effect of concentrating the\\nlines of force. The armature generally revolves in small\\ndynamos, but in large ones it is usually a fixture, while the\\nelectro-magnets revolve. Plate IV. shows a typical dynamo\\nand its parts.',\n",
       " 'As we saw in an earlier chapter, an electro-magnet has\\nmagnetic powers only while a current is being passed\\nthrough its winding, and so some means of supplying\\ncurrent to the electro-magnets in a dynamo must be provided.\\nIt is a remarkable fact that it is almost impossible\\nto obtain a piece of iron which has not some traces of\\nmagnetism, and so when a dynamo is first set up there is\\noften sufficient magnetism in the iron of the electro-magnets\\nto produce a very weak field. The rapid cutting of the\\nfeeble lines of force of this field sets up a weak current,\\nwhich, acting upon the electro-magnets, gradually brings\\nthem up to full strength. Once the dynamo is generating\\ncurrent it keeps on feeding its magnets by sending either\\nthe whole or a part of its current through them. After\\nit has once been set going the dynamo is always able to\\nstart again, because the magnet cores retain enough\\nmagnetism to set up a weak field. If there is not enough\\nmagnetism in the cores to start a dynamo for the first\\ntime, a current from some outside source is sent round the\\nmagnets.',\n",
       " 'The foregoing remarks apply to continuous current\\ndynamos only. Alternating current can be used for exciting\\nelectro-magnets, but in this case the magnetic field produced\\nis alternating also, so that each pole of the magnet has\\nnorth and south magnetism alternately. This will not do\\nfor dynamo field magnets, and therefore an alternating\\ncurrent dynamo cannot feed its own magnets. The electro-magnets\\nin such dynamos are supplied with current from a72\\nseparate continuous current dynamo, which may be of quite\\nsmall size.',\n",
       " 'It is a very interesting fact that electric current can\\nbe generated by a dynamo in which the earth itself is\\nused to provide the magnetic field, no permanent or electro-magnets\\nbeing used at all.

       " 'The dynamo provides us with a constant supply of\\nelectric current, but this current is no use unless we can\\nmake it do work for us. If we reverse the usual order of\\nthings in regard to a dynamo, and supply the machine with\\ncurrent instead of mechanical power, we find that the\\narmature begins to revolve rapidly, and the machine is\\nno longer a dynamo, but has become an electric motor.\\nThis shows us that an electric motor is simply a dynamo\\nreversed. Let us suppose that we wish to use the\\ndynamo in Fig. 20 as a motor. In order to supply the\\ncurrent we will take away the lamp and substitute a\\nsecond continuous-current dynamo. We know from\\nChapter VII. that when a current is sent through a coil\\nof wire the coil becomes a magnet with a north and a\\nsouth pole. The coil in our dynamo becomes a magnet\\nas soon as the current is switched on, and the attraction\\nbetween its poles and the opposite poles of the magnet\\ncauses it to make half a revolution. At this point the\\ncommutator reverses the current, and consequently the\\npolarity of the coil, so that there is now repulsion where\\npreviously there was attraction, and the coil makes another\\nhalf-revolution. So the process goes on until the armature\\nattains a very high speed. In general construction there is\\npractically no difference between a dynamo and a motor,73\\nbut there are differences in detail which adapt each to its\\nown particular work. By making certain alterations in\\ntheir construction electric motors can be run with alternating\\ncurrent.',\n",
       " 'The fact that a dynamo could be reversed and run as a\\nmotor was known probably as early as 1838, but the great\\nvalue of this reversibility does not seem to have been\\nrealized until 1873. At an industrial exhibition held at\\nVienna in that year, it so happened that a workman or\\nmachinery attendant connected two cables to a dynamo\\nwhich was standing idle, and he was much surprised to\\nfind that it at once began to revolve at a great speed. It\\nwas then seen that the cables led to another dynamo which\\nwas running, and that the current from this source had\\nmade the first dynamo into a motor. There are many\\nversions of this story, but the important point in all\\nis that this was the first occasion on which general\\nattention was drawn to the possibilities of the electric\\nmotor.',\n",
       " 'The practical advantages afforded by the electric motor\\nare many and great. Once we have installed a sufficiently\\npowerful dynamo and a steam or other engine to drive it,\\nwe can place motors just where they are required, either\\nclose to the dynamo or miles away, driving them simply by\\nmeans of a connecting cable. In factories, motors can be\\nplaced close to the machines they are required to drive,\\nanywhere in the building, thus doing away with all complicated\\nand dangerous systems of shafting and belts. In\\nmany cases where it would be either utterly impossible or\\nat least extremely inconvenient to use any form of steam,\\ngas, or oil engine, electric motors can be employed without\\nthe slightest difficulty. In order to realize this, one only\\nhas to think of the positions in which electrically-driven\\nventilating fans are placed, or of the unpleasantly familiar74\\nelectric drill of the dentist. An electric motor is small and\\ncompact, gives off no fumes and practically no heat, makes\\nvery little noise, is capable of running for very long periods\\nat high speed and with the utmost steadiness, and requires\\nextremely little attention.',\n",
       " 'It is apparently a very simple matter to fit up a power\\nstation with a number of very large dynamos driven by\\npowerful engines, and to distribute the current produced by\\nthese dynamos to all parts of a town or district by means\\nof cables, but as a matter of fact it is a fairly complicated\\nengineering problem. First of all the source of power for\\ndriving the dynamos has to be considered. In private and\\nother small power plants, gas, petrol or oil engines are\\ngenerally used, but for large stations the choice lies between\\nsteam and water power. In this country steam power is\\nused almost exclusively. Formerly the ordinary reciprocating\\nsteam engines were always employed, and though these\\nare still in very extensive use, they are being superseded in\\nmany cases by steam turbines. The turbine is capable of\\nrunning at higher speeds than the reciprocating engine, and\\nat the greatest speeds it runs with a great deal less noise,\\nand with practically no vibration at all. More than this,\\nturbines take up much less room, and require less oil and\\nattendance. The turbines are coupled directly to the\\ndynamos, so that the two machines appear almost as one.\\nIn the power station shown on Plate V. a number of alternating\\ncurrent dynamos coupled to steam turbines are seen.',\n",
       " 'A large power station consumes enormous quantities of\\ncoal, and for convenience of supply it is situated on the\\nbank of a river or canal, or, if neither of these is available,76\\nas close to the railway as possible. The unloading of the\\ncoal barges or trucks is done mechanically, the coal passing\\ninto a large receiving hopper. From here it is taken to\\nanother hopper close to the furnaces by means of coal\\nelevators and conveyors, which consist of a number of\\nbuckets fixed at short intervals on an endless travelling\\nchain. From the furnace hopper the coal is fed into the\\nfurnaces by mechanical stokers, and the resulting ash and\\nclinker falls into a pit below the furnaces, from which it is\\ncarted away.',\n",
       " 'The heat produced in the furnaces is used to generate\\nsteam, and from the boilers the steam passes to the engines\\nalong a steam pipe. After doing its work in the engines,\\nthe steam generally passes to a condenser, in which it is\\ncooled to water, freed from oil and grease, and returned to\\nthe boilers to be transformed once more into steam. As\\nthis water from the condenser is quite warm, less heat is\\nrequired to raise steam from it than would be the case if\\nthe boiler supply were kept up with cold water. The\\npower generated by the engines is used to drive the\\ndynamos, and stout copper cables convey the current from\\nthese to what are called “bus” bars. There are two of\\nthese, one receiving the positive cable from the dynamos,\\nand the other the negative cable, and the bars run from end\\nto end of a large main switchboard. From this switchboard\\nthe current is distributed by other cables known as feeders.',\n",
       " 'The nature of the current generated at a power station\\nis determined to a great extent by the size of the district to\\nbe supplied. Generally speaking, where the current is not\\nto be transmitted beyond a radius of about two miles from\\nthe station, continuous current is generated; while alternating\\ncurrent is employed for the supply of larger areas. In\\nsome cases both kinds of current are generated at one\\nstation.',\n",
       " 'If continuous current is to be used, it is generated\\nusually at a pressure of from 400 to 500 volts, the average\\nbeing about 440 volts; and the supply is generally on what\\nis known as the three-wire system. Three separate wires\\nare employed. The two outer wires are connected\\nrespectively to the positive and the negative bus bars\\nrunning along the main switchboard, these bars receiving\\npositive or negative current directly from the dynamos.\\nThe outer wires therefore carry current at the full voltage\\nof the system. Between them is a third and smaller wire,\\nconnected to a third bar, much smaller than the outer bars,\\nand known as the mid-wire bar. This bar is not connected\\nto the dynamos, but to earth, by means of a large plate of\\ncopper sunk into the ground. Connexion between the\\nmid-wire bar and the outer bars is made by two machines\\ncalled “balancers,” one connecting the mid-wire bar and the\\npositive bus bar, and the other the mid-wire bar and the\\nnegative bus bar. If the pressure between the outer bars\\nis 440 volts, then the pressure between the mid-wire bar and\\neither of the outer bars will be 220 volts, that is just half.',\n",
       " 'The balancers serve the purpose of balancing the\\nvoltage on each side, and they are machines capable of\\nacting either as motors or dynamos. In order to comply\\nwith Board of Trade regulations, electric appliances of all\\nkinds intended for ordinary domestic purposes, including\\nlamps, and heating and cooking apparatus, are supplied\\nwith current at a pressure not exceeding 250 volts. In a\\nsystem such as we are describing, all these appliances are\\nconnected between the mid-wire and one or other of the\\nouter wires, thus receiving current at 220 volts. In\\npractice it is impossible to arrange matters so that the\\nlamps and other appliances connected with the positive side\\nof the system shall always take the same amount of current\\nas those connected with the negative side, and there is78\\nalways liable to be a much greater load on one side or the\\nother. If, for instance, a heavy load is thrown on the\\nnegative side, the voltage on that side will drop. The\\nbalancer on the positive side then acts as an electric motor,\\ndrives the balancer on the negative side as a dynamo, and\\nthus provides the current required to raise the voltage on\\nthe negative side until the balance is restored. The working\\nof the balancers, which need not be described in further\\ndetail, is practically automatic. Electric motors, for driving\\nelectric trams or machinery of any kind, are connected\\nbetween the outer wires, so that they receive the full 440\\nvolts of the system.',\n",
       " 'In any electric supply system the demand for current\\ndoes not remain constant, but fluctuates more or less. For\\ninstance, in a system including an electric tramway, if a car\\nbreaks down and remains a fixture for a short time, all cars\\nbehind it are held up, and a long line of cars is quickly\\nformed. When the breakdown is repaired, all the cars\\nstart practically at the same instant, and consequently a\\nsudden and tremendous demand for current is made. In a\\nvery large tramway system in a fairly level city, the\\nfluctuations in the demand for current, apart from accidents,\\nare not very serious, for they tend to average themselves;\\nbut in a small system, and particularly if the district is hilly,\\nthe fluctuations are very great, and the current demand\\nmay vary as much as from 400 to 2000 amperes. Again,\\nin a system supplying power and light, the current demand\\nrises rapidly as the daylight fails on winter afternoons,\\nbecause, while workshop and other motors are still in full\\nswing, thousands of electric lamps are switched on more or\\nless at the same time. The power station must be able to\\ndeal with any exceptional demands which are likely to\\noccur, and consequently more current must be available\\nthan is actually required under average conditions. Instead79\\nof having generating machinery large enough to meet all\\nunusual demands, the generators at a station using continuous\\ncurrent may be only of sufficient size to supply a little\\nmore than the average demand, any current beyond this\\nbeing supplied by a battery of storage cells. The battery\\nis charged during periods when the demand for current is\\nsmall, and when a heavy load comes on, the current from\\nthe battery relieves the generators of the sudden strain.\\nTo be of any service for such a purpose the storage battery\\nof course must be very large. Plate VI. shows a large\\nbattery of no cells, and some idea of the size of the\\nindividual cells may be obtained from the fact that each\\nweighs about 3900 lb.',\n",
       " 'Alternating current is produced at almost all power\\nstations supplying large districts. It is generated at high\\npressure, from 2000 volts upwards, the highest pressure\\nemployed in this country being about 11,000 volts. Such\\npressures are of course very much too high for electric\\nlamps or motors, and the object of generating current of\\nthis kind is to secure the greatest economy in transmission\\nthrough the long cables. Electric energy is measured in\\nwatts, the watts being obtained by multiplying together\\nthe pressure or voltage of the current, and its rate of flow\\nor amperage. From this it will be seen that, providing the\\nproduct of voltage and amperage remains the same, it\\nmakes no difference, so far as electric energy is concerned,\\nwhether the current be of high voltage and low amperage,\\nor of low voltage and high amperage. Now in transmitting\\na current through a long cable, there is a certain\\namount of loss due to the heating of the conductor. This\\nheating is caused by the current flow, not by the pressure;\\nand the heavier the current, the greater the heating, and\\nthe greater the loss. This being so, it is clear that by\\ndecreasing the current flow, and correspondingly increasing80\\nthe pressure, the loss in transmission will be reduced; and\\nthis is why alternating current is generated at high pressure\\nwhen it is to be transmitted to a distance.',\n",
       " 'The kind of alternating current generated is usually\\nthat known as three-phase current. Formerly single-phase\\ncurrent was in general use, but it has been superseded by\\nthree-phase current because the latter is more economical\\nto generate and to distribute, and also more satisfactory for\\nelectric motors. The actual voltage of the current sent out\\nfrom the station varies according to the distance to which\\nthe current is to be conveyed. In the United States and\\nin other countries where current has to be conveyed to\\nplaces a hundred or even more miles from the station,\\npressures as high as 120,000 volts are in use. It is possible\\nto produce alternating current at such pressures directly\\nfrom the dynamos, but in practice this is never done, on\\naccount of the great liability to breakdown of the insulation.\\nInstead, the current is generated at from 2000 to 10,000 or\\n11,000 volts, and raised to the required pressure, before\\nleaving the station, by means of a step-up transformer.\\nWe have seen that an induction coil raises, or steps up, the\\nvoltage of the current supplied to it. A step-up transformer\\nworks on the same principle as the induction coil, and in\\npassing through it the current is raised in voltage, but\\ncorrespondingly lowered in amperage. Of course, if the\\npressure of the current generated by the dynamos is already\\nsufficiently high to meet the local requirements, the transformer\\nis not used.',\n",
       " 'For town supply the current from the power station is\\nled along underground cables to a number of sub-stations,\\nsituated in different parts of the town, and generally underground.\\nAt each sub-station the current passes through a\\nstep-down transformer, which also acts on the principle of the\\ninduction coil, but in the reverse way, so that the voltage is\\nlowered instead of being raised. From the transformer the\\ncurrent emerges at the pressure required for use, but it is\\nstill alternating current; and if it is desired to have a\\ncontinuous-current supply this alternating current must be\\nconverted. One of the simplest arrangements for this\\npurpose consists of an electric motor and a dynamo, the\\ntwo being coupled together. The motor is constructed to\\nrun on the alternating current from the transformer, and\\nit drives the dynamo, which is arranged to generate continuous\\ncurrent. There is also a machine called a “rotary\\nconverter,” which is largely used instead of the motor\\ngenerator.

       " 'In many parts of the world, especially in America,\\nwater power is utilized to a considerable extent instead of\\nsteam for the generation of electric current. The immense\\nvolume of water passing over the Falls of Niagara develops\\nenergy equal to about seven million horse-power, and a\\nsmall amount of this energy, roughly about three-quarters\\nof a million horse-power, has been harnessed and made to\\nproduce electric current for light and power. The water\\npasses down a number of penstocks, which are tubes or\\ntunnels about 7 feet in diameter, lined with brick and\\nconcrete; and at the bottom of these tubes are placed\\npowerful water turbines. The falling water presses upon\\nthe vanes of the turbines, setting them revolving at great\\nspeed, and the power produced in this way is used to drive\\na series of very large alternating current dynamos.

       " 'The superiority of the trolley system lies in the fact that\\nit is cheaper to construct and to maintain than the other\\ntwo, and also in its much greater reliability under all\\nworking conditions. The overhead wire is not one continuous\\ncable, but is divided into sections of about half a\\nmile in length, each section being supplied with current\\nfrom a separate main. At each point where the current\\nis fed to the trolley wire a sort of metal box may be seen\\nat the side of the street. These boxes are called “feeder\\npillars,” and each contains a switch by means of which the\\ncurrent can be cut off from that particular section, for\\nrepairing or other purposes. Above the car is fixed an arm\\nprovided with a trolley wheel which runs along the wire,\\nand this wheel takes the current from the wire. From the\\nwheel the current passes down the trolley arm to the\\ncontroller, which is operated by the driver, and from there\\nto the motors beneath the car. Leaving the motors it\\npasses to the wheels and then to the rails, from which it\\nis led off at intervals by cables and so returned to the\\ngenerating station.

When the car is started the motors are\\nconnected in series, so that the full current passes through\\neach, while the pressure is divided between them; but\\nwhen the car is well on the move the controller connects\\nthe motors in parallel, so that each receives the full pressure\\nof the current.',\n",

These switches are arranged to be moved by\\nmagnets fixed beneath the car, and thus when the car\\npasses over a stud the magnets work the switch and connect\\nthe stud to the conductors, so that the stud is then\\n“alive.” The current is taken from the studs by means of\\nsliding brushes or skates which are carried by the car.\\nThe studs are thus alive only when the car is passing over86\\nthem, and at all other times they are dead, and not in any\\nway dangerous.',\n",

These brakes are operated by electro-magnets\\nof great power, the current necessary to excite the\\nmagnets being taken from the motors. Finally there is\\na most interesting and ingenious method of regenerative\\ncontrol.

In Plate VII. is seen an electric\\nlocomotive hauling a train of coal waggons in a colliery\\nnear the Tyne, and it will be seen that the overhead\\nsystem is used, the trolley arm and wheel being replaced\\nby sliding bows. In a colliery railway it is generally\\nimpossible to select the most favourable track from the\\nrailway constructor’s point of view, as the line must be\\narranged to serve certain points. This often means taking\\nthe line sometimes through low tunnels or bridges where\\nthe overhead wire must be low, and sometimes over public\\nroads where the wire must be high; and the sliding bow88\\nis better able than the trolley arm and wheel to adapt\\nitself to these variations.

There\\nare many reasons for the failure of these attempts. The\\nweight of a battery of accumulators large enough to run a\\ncar with a load of passengers is tremendous, and this is\\nof course so much dead weight to be hauled along, and it\\nbecomes a very serious matter when steep hills have to be\\nnegotiated. When a car is started on a steep up-gradient\\na sudden and heavy demand for current is made, and this\\nputs upon the accumulators a strain which they are not91\\nable to bear without injury. Another great drawback is\\nthe comparatively short time for which accumulators can\\ngive a heavy current, for this necessitates the frequent\\nreturn of the cars to the central station in order to have\\nthe batteries re-charged.

When the carbons\\nare placed horizontally, the glowing mass is carried upwards\\nby the ascending currents of heated air, and it assumes the\\narch-like form from which it gets its name. If the carbons\\nare vertical the curve is not produced, a more or less\\nstraight line being formed instead.

With continuous current, if the carbon\\nrods are fully exposed to the air, they gradually consume\\naway, and minute particles of carbon are carried across\\nfrom the positive rod to the negative rod, so that the former\\nwastes at about twice the rate of the latter. The end of\\nthe positive rod becomes hollowed out so as to resemble a\\nlittle crater, and the end of the negative rod becomes more\\nor less pointed. The fact that with continuous current the\\npositive rod consumes away twice as fast as the negative\\nrod, may be taken advantage of to decrease the cost of new\\ncarbons, by replacing the wasted positive rod with a new\\none, and using the unconsumed portion of the old positive\\nrod as a new negative rod.1 If alternating current is used,\\neach rod in turn becomes the positive rod, so that no crater95\\nis formed, and both the carbons have the same shape and\\nare consumed at the same rate.

In arc lamps this pushing together,\\nor “feeding” as it is called, is done automatically, as\\nis also the first bringing together and separating of the rods\\nto start or strike the arc. Fig. 21 shows a simple arrangement\\nfor this purpose. A is the positive carbon, and B\\nthe negative. C is the holder for the positive carbon, and\\nthis is connected to the rod D, which is made of soft iron.96\\nThis rod is wound with two separate coils of wire as shown,\\ncoil E having a low resistance, and coil F a high one.\\nThese two coils are solenoids, and D is the core,\\n(Chapter VII.). When the lamp is not in use, the weight of\\nthe holder keeps the positive carbon in contact with the\\nnegative carbon. When switched on, the current flows\\nalong the cable to the point H. Here it has two paths\\nopen to it, one through coil E to the positive carbon, and\\nthe other through coil F and back to the source of supply.\\nBut coil E has a much lower\\nresistance than coil F, and\\nso most of the current\\nchooses the easier path\\nthrough E, only a small\\namount of current taking\\nthe path through the other\\ncoil. Both coils are now\\nmagnetized, and E tends to\\ndraw the rod D upwards,\\nwhile F tends to pull it\\ndownwards. Coil E, however,\\nhas much greater power\\nthan coil F, because a much\\nlarger amount of current is\\npassing through it; and so it overcomes the feeble pull of F,\\nand draws up the rod. The raising of D lifts the positive\\ncarbon away from the negative carbon, and the arc is struck.\\nThe carbons now begin to waste away, and very slowly the\\ndistance between them increases. The path of the current\\npassing through coil E is from carbon A to carbon B by\\nway of the arc, and as the length of the gap between A\\nand B increases, the resistance of this path also increases.\\nThe way through coil E thus becomes less easy, and as\\ntime goes on more and more current takes the alternative97\\npath through coil F. This results in a decrease in the\\nmagnetism of E, and an increase in that of F, and at a\\ncertain point F becomes the more powerful of the two, and\\npulls down the rod. In this way the positive carbon is\\nlowered and brought nearer to the negative carbon.\\nDirectly the diminishing distance between A and B reaches\\na certain limit, coil E once more asserts its superiority, and\\nby overcoming the pull of F it stops the further approach\\nof the carbons. So, by the opposing forces of the two\\ncoils, the carbons are maintained between safe limits, in\\nspite of their wasting away.',\n",

The absence of red rays\\nalters colour-values greatly, scarlet objects appearing\\nblack; and on this account it is impossible to match colours\\nby this light. In many respects, however, the deficiency\\nin red rays is a great positive advantage. Every one who\\nhas worked by mercury vapour light must have noticed\\nthat it enables very fine details to be seen with remarkable\\ndistinctness. This property is due to an interesting fact.\\nDaylight and ordinary artificial light is a compound or\\nmixture of rays of different colours. It is a well-known\\noptical fact that a simple lens is unable to bring all these\\nrays to the same focus; so that if we sharply focus an image\\nby red light, it is out of focus or blurred by blue light. This\\ndefect of the lens is called “chromatic aberration.” The\\neye too suffers from chromatic aberration, so that it cannot\\nfocus sharply all the different rays at the same time. The\\nviolet rays are brought to a focus considerably in front of\\nthe red rays, and the green and the yellow rays come in\\nbetween the two. The eye therefore automatically and102\\nunconsciously effects a compromise, and focuses for the\\ngreenish-yellow rays. The mercury vapour light consists\\nvery largely of these rays, and consequently it enables the\\nimage to be focused with greater sharpness; or, in other\\nwords, it increases the acuteness of vision. Experiments\\ncarried out by Dr. Louis Bell and Dr. C.\\xa0H. Williams\\ndemonstrated this increase in visual sharpness very conclusively.\\nType, all of exactly the same size, was examined\\nby mercury vapour light, and by the light from an electric\\nincandescent lamp with tungsten filament. The feeling of\\nsharper definition produced by the mercury vapour light\\nwas so strong that many observers were certain that the\\ntype was larger, and they were convinced that it was\\nexactly the same only after careful personal examination.',\n",

The ends of the spiral were\\nconnected to outside wires sealed into the bulb. It was\\nfound, however, that keeping platinum continuously at a\\nhigh temperature caused it to disintegrate slowly, so that\\nthe lamps had only a short life. Fine threads or filaments\\nof carbon were then tried, and found to be much more\\ndurable, besides being a great deal cheaper. The carbon\\nfilament lamp quickly became a commercial success, and\\nup to quite recent years it was the only form of electric\\nincandescent lamp in general use.',\n",

Early in\\n1911 lamps having a filament consisting of a single continuous\\npiece of drawn tungsten wire were produced. It\\nhad been known for some time that although tungsten was\\nso brittle at ordinary temperatures, it became quite soft\\nand flexible when heated to incandescence in the lamp, and\\nthat it lost this quality again as soon as it cooled down.\\nA process was discovered by which the metal could be\\nmade permanently ductile, by mechanical treatment while\\nin the heated state. In this process pure tungsten powder\\nis pressed into rods and then made coherent by heating.\\nWhile still hot it is hammered, and finally drawn out into\\nfine wires through diamond dies. The wire is no thicker\\nthan a fine hair, and it varies in size from about 0·012 mm.\\nto about 0·375 mm., according to the amount of current it\\nis intended to take. It is mounted by winding it continuously\\nzigzag shape round a glass carrier, which has at\\nthe top and the bottom a number of metal supports\\narranged in the form of a star, and insulated by a central\\nrod of glass. One star is made of strong, stiff material,105\\nand the other consists of fine wires of some refractory\\nmetal, molybdenum being used in the Osram lamps.\\nThese supports act as springs, and keep the wire securely\\nin its original shape, no matter in what position the lamp\\nis used.

Perhaps the nearest\\napproach to light without heat is the so-called “cold light”\\ninvented by M. Dussaud, a French scientist. His device\\nconsists of a revolving ring of exactly similar tungsten\\nlamps. Each of these lamps has current passed through it\\nin turn, and the duration of the current in each is so short,\\nbeing only a fraction of a second, that the lamp has not\\nsufficient time to develop any appreciable amount of heat.\\nThe light from the ring of lamps is brought to a focus, and\\npassed through a lens to wherever it is required. Electric\\nincandescent lamps are made in a variety of sizes, each one\\nbeing intended for a certain definite voltage. If a lamp\\ndesigned for, say, 8 volts, is used on a circuit of\\n32 volts, its candle-power is greatly increased, while the\\namount of current consumed is not increased in proportion.\\nIn this way the lamp becomes a more efficient source\\nof light, but the “over-running,” as it is called, has a\\ndestructive effect on the filament, so that the life of the\\nlamp is greatly shortened. In the Dussaud system however\\nthe time during which each lamp has current passing\\nthrough it is so short, followed by a period of rest, that\\nthe destructive effect of over-running is reduced to the\\nminimum; so that by using very high voltages an extremely\\nbrilliant light is safely obtained with a comparatively\\nsmall consumption of current. It might be thought\\nthat the constant interchange of lamps would result in an\\nunsteady effect, but the substitution of one lamp for another\\nis carried out so rapidly that the eye gets the impression of\\nperfect steadiness.

The well-known substance\\ncalcium carbide, so much used for producing acetylene gas\\nfor lighting purposes, is a compound of calcium and\\ncarbon; it is made by raising a mixture of lime and coke\\nto an intense heat in an electric furnace. The manufacture\\nof calcium carbide is carried on on a very large scale at\\nNiagara, with electric power obtained from the Falls, and\\nat Odda in Norway, where the power is supplied by the\\nriver Tysse. Carborundum, a substance almost as hard\\nas the diamond, is largely used for grinding and polishing\\npurposes. It is manufactured by sending a strong current\\nthrough a furnace containing a core of coke surrounded by\\na mixture of sand, sawdust, and carbon. The core becomes\\nincandescent, and the heating is continued until the\\ncarbon combines with the sand, the process taking about\\na day. Graphite, a kind of carbon, occurs naturally in the\\nform of plumbago, which is used for making black lead\\npencils. It is obtained by mining, but many of the mines113\\nare already worked out, and others will be exhausted\\nbefore long. By means of the electric furnace, graphite\\ncan now be made artificially, by heating anthracite\\ncoal, and at Niagara a quantity running into thousands\\nof tons is produced every year.

       " 'A chapter on electric heating would not be complete\\nwithout some mention of electric welding. Welding is the\\nprocess of uniting two pieces of metal by means of a combination\\nof heat and pressure, so that a strong and permanent\\njoint is produced. The chief difficulty in welding is\\nthat of securing and keeping up the proper temperature,\\nand some metals are much more troublesome than others\\nin this respect. Platinum, iron, and steel are fairly easy to\\nweld, but most of the other metals, and alloys of different\\nmetals, require very exact regulation of temperature. It\\nis almost impossible to obtain this exact regulation by\\nordinary methods of heating, but the electric current makes\\nit a comparatively easy matter. The principle of ordinary\\nelectric welding is very simple. The ends of the two\\npieces of metal are placed together, and a powerful current\\nis passed through them. This current meets with a high\\nresistance at the point of contact of the two pieces, and so\\nheat is produced. When the proper welding temperature\\nis reached, and the metal is in a sort of pasty condition,\\nthe two pieces are pressed strongly together, and the\\ncurrent is switched off. The pieces are now firmly united\\ntogether. The process may be carried out by hand, the\\nwelding smith switching the current on and off, and applying\\npressure at the right moment by means of hydraulic\\npower.

       " 'The most familiar of all electrically worked appliances is\\nprobably the electric bell, which in some form or other is\\nin use practically all over the world. Electric bells are\\noperated by means of a current of electricity sent through\\nthe coils of an electro-magnet, and one of the very simplest\\nforms is that known as the single-stroke bell. In this bell\\nan armature or piece of soft iron is placed across, but at a\\nlittle distance from, the poles of an electro-magnet, and to\\nthis piece of iron is fixed a lever terminating in a sort of\\nknob which lies close to a bell or gong. When a current\\nis sent round the electro-magnet the armature is attracted,\\nso that the lever moves forward and strikes a sharp blow\\nupon the gong. Before the gong can be sounded a second\\ntime the current must be interrupted in order to make the\\nmagnet release the armature, so that the lever may fall\\nback to its original position. Thus the bell gives only one\\nring each time the circuit is closed. Bells of this kind may\\nbe used for signalling in exactly the same way as the Morse\\nsounder, and sometimes they are made with two gongs of\\ndifferent tones, which are arranged so as to be sounded\\nalternately.',\n",
       " 'For most purposes however another form called the\\ntrembler bell is much more convenient. Fig. 24 is a rough\\ndiagram of the usual arrangement of the essential parts of\\na trembler bell. When the circuit is closed by pressing the117\\nbell-push, a current flows from the battery to the electro-magnet\\nEE, by way of terminal T. The electro-magnet\\nthen attracts the soft iron armature\\nA, thus causing the hammer H to\\nstrike the gong. But immediately\\nthe armature is pulled away from\\nthe terminal T¹ the circuit is\\nbroken and the magnet loses its\\nattraction for the armature, which\\nis moved back again into contact\\nwith T¹ by the spring S. The\\ncircuit is thus again closed, the\\narmature is again attracted, and\\nthe hammer strikes the gong a\\nsecond time. This process goes\\non over and over again at a great\\nspeed as long as the bell-push is\\nkept pressed down, resulting in\\nan extremely rapid succession of\\nstrokes upon the gong.

For\\nhousehold purposes this\\nform of bell has completely\\ndriven out the once popular\\nwire-pulled bell. Bell-pushes\\nare made in a\\nnumber of shapes and\\nforms, and Fig. 25 will\\nmake clear the working\\nprinciple of the familiar form which greets us from almost\\nevery doorway with the invitation, “Press.” In private\\noffices and elsewhere the rather aggressive sound of an118\\nordinary trembler bell is apt to become a nuisance, and\\nin such cases a modified form which gives a quiet buzzing\\nsound is often employed.',\n",
       " 'It is frequently necessary to have an electric bell which,\\nwhen once started, will continue ringing until it is stopped.\\nSuch bells are used for fire and burglar alarms and for\\nmany other similar purposes, and they are called continuous-ringing\\nbells as distinguished from the ordinary\\ntrembler bells. In one common form of continuous-ringing\\nbell two separate batteries are used, one to start the bell\\nand the other to keep it ringing. When a momentary\\ncurrent from the first battery is sent over the bell lines the\\narmature is attracted by the electro-magnet, and its movement\\nallows a lever to fall upon a metal contact piece.\\nThis closes the circuit of the second battery, which keeps\\nthe bell ringing until the lever is replaced by pulling a cord\\nor pressing a knob. Continuous-ringing bells are often\\nfitted to alarm clocks. The alarm is set in the usual way,\\nand at the appointed hour the bell begins to ring, and goes\\non ringing until its owner, able to stand the noise no longer,\\ngets out of bed to stop it.',\n",

Before reaching the bell the wire\\nfrom each bell-push passes round a separate small electro-magnet,\\nwhich is thus magnetized by the current at the\\nsame time that the bell is rung. In the simplest form of\\nindicator the attraction of the magnet causes a little flag to\\nswing backwards and forwards over its number. Another\\nform is the drop indicator, in which the movement of the\\narmature when attracted by the magnet allows a little flag\\nto drop, thus exposing the number of the room from which\\nthe bell was rung. The dropped flag has to be replaced,\\neither by means of a knob fixed to a rod which pushes the\\nflag up again, or by pressing a push which sends the\\ncurrent through another little electro-magnet so arranged\\nas to re-set the flag.',\n",

Other contacts are concealed\\nunder the doormats, and under the carpets in passages and\\nstairways, so that the burglar is practically certain to tread\\non one or other of them and so rouse the house.

We are so accustomed to walking into a telegraph\\noffice, filling up a form, and paying our sixpence or more,\\nthat it is very difficult for us to realize the immense importance\\nof the electric telegraph; and probably the best\\nway of doing this is to try to imagine the state of things\\nwhich would result if the world’s telegraphic instruments\\nwere put out of action for a week or two.',\n",
       " 'The earliest attempts at the construction of an electric\\ntelegraph date back to a time long before the discovery of\\nthe electric current. As early as 1727 it was known that\\nan electric discharge could be transmitted to a considerable\\ndistance through a conducting substance such as a moistened\\nthread or a wire, and this fact suggested the possibility of129\\na method of electric signalling. In 1753 a writer in Scott’s\\nMagazine brought forward an ingenious scheme based upon\\nthe attraction between an electrified body and any light\\nsubstance. His telegraph was worked by an electric\\nmachine, and it consisted of twenty-six separate parallel\\nwires, every wire having a metal ball suspended from it at\\neach end. Close to each ball was placed a small piece of\\npaper upon which was written a letter of the alphabet.\\nWhen any wire was charged, the paper letters at each end\\nof it were attracted towards the metal balls, and in this\\nway words and sentences were spelled out. Many other\\nsystems more or less on the same lines were suggested\\nduring the next fifty years, but although some of them had\\nconsiderable success in an experimental way, they were all\\nfar too unreliable to have any commercial success.',\n",
       " 'With the invention of the voltaic cell, inventors’ ideas\\ntook a new direction. In 1812 a telegraph based upon the\\npower of an electric current to decompose water was\\ndevised by a German named Sömmering. He used a\\nnumber of separate wires, each connected to a gold pin\\nprojecting from below into a glass vessel filled with\\nacidulated water. There were thirty-five wires in all, for\\nletters and numbers, and when a current was sent along\\nany wire bubbles of gas formed at the pin at the end of it,\\nand so the letters or numbers were indicated. This telegraph,\\nlike its predecessors, never came into practical use.\\nOersted’s discovery in 1829 of the production of magnetism\\nby electricity laid the foundation of the first really practical\\nelectric telegraphs, but little progress was made until the\\nappearance of the Daniell cell, in 1836. The earlier forms\\nof voltaic cells polarized so rapidly that it was impossible\\nto obtain a constant current from them, but the non-polarizing\\nDaniell cell at once removed all difficulty in this\\nrespect. In the year 1837 three separate practical telegraphs130\\nwere invented: by Morse in the United States, by\\nWheatstone and Cooke in England, and by Steinheil in\\nMunich.',\n",
       " 'The first telegraph of Wheatstone and Cooke consisted\\nof five magnetic needles\\npivoted on a vertical\\ndial. The letters of the\\nalphabet were marked\\non the dial, and the\\nneedles were deflected\\nby currents made to\\npass through wires by\\nthe depression of keys,\\nso that two needles\\nwould point towards\\nthe required letter.\\nFig. 26 is a sketch of\\nthe dial of this apparatus.\\nThis telegraph was\\ntried successfully on the\\nLondon and North-Western\\nRailway, over\\na wire a mile and a half\\nin length. Wheatstone\\nand Cooke afterwards\\ninvented a single-needle\\ntelegraph in which the\\nletters were indicated\\nby movements of the needle to the right or to the left,\\naccording to the direction of a current sent through a coil\\nof wire. Wheatstone subsequently produced an apparatus\\nwhich printed the letters on paper.',\n",
       " 'In the United States, Morse had thought out a scheme\\nof telegraphy in 1832, but it was not until 1837 that he got131\\nhis apparatus into working order. He was an artist by\\nprofession, and for a long time he was unable to develop\\nhis ideas for lack of money. After many efforts he succeeded\\nin obtaining a State grant of £6000 for the\\nconstruction of a telegraph line between Baltimore and\\nWashington, and the first message over this line was sent\\nin 1844, the line being thrown open to the public in the\\nfollowing year. Amongst the features of this telegraph\\nwere a receiving instrument which automatically recorded\\nthe messages on a moving paper ribbon, by means of a\\npencil actuated by an electro-magnet; and an apparatus\\ncalled a relay, which enabled the recording instrument to\\nbe worked when the current was enfeebled by the resistance\\nof a very long wire. Morse also devised a telegraphic\\ncode which is practically the same as that in use to-day.',\n",
       " 'The great discovery of the German Steinheil was that\\na second wire for the return of the current was not necessary,\\nand that the earth could be used for this part of the circuit.',\n",
       " 'In reading the early history of great inventions one is\\ncontinually struck with the indifference or even hostility\\nshown by the general public. In England the electric\\ntelegraph was practically ignored until the capture of a\\nmurderer by means of it literally forced the public to see\\nits value. The murder was committed near Slough, and\\nthe murderer succeeded in taking train for London.\\nFortunately the Great Western Railway had a telegraph\\nline between Slough and London, and a description telegraphed\\nto Paddington enabled the police to arrest the\\nmurderer on his arrival. In the United States too there\\nwas just the same indifference. The rate for messages on\\nthe line between Baltimore and Washington was one cent\\nfor four words, and the total amount taken during the first\\nfour days was one cent!',\n",
       " 'One of the simplest forms of telegraph is the single-needle132\\ninstrument. This consists of a magnetic needle\\nfixed to a spindle at the back of an upright board through\\nwhich the spindle is passed. On the same spindle, but in\\nfront of the board, is fixed a dial needle, which, of course,\\nmoves along with the magnetic needle. A coil of wire is\\npassed round the magnetic needle, and connected to a\\ncommutator for reversing\\nthe direction of the\\ncurrent. By turning a\\nhandle to the left a\\ncurrent is made to flow\\nthrough the coil, and\\nthe magnetic needle\\nmoves to one side; but\\nif the handle is turned\\nto the right the current\\nflows through the coil\\nin the opposite direction,\\nand the needle\\nmoves to the other\\nside. Instead of a\\nhandle, two keys may\\nbe used, the movement\\nof the needle varying\\naccording to which key\\nis pressed. A good\\noperator can transmit\\nat the rate of about twenty words a minute with this\\ninstrument. The Morse code, which consists of combinations\\nof dots and dashes, is used, a movement of the\\ndial needle to the left meaning a dot, and one to the right\\na dash. The code as used in the single-needle instrument\\nis shown in Fig. 27.',\n",
       " 'Needle instruments are largely used in railway signal133\\ncabins, but for general telegraphic work an instrument\\ncalled the Morse sounder is employed. This consists of\\nan electro-magnet which, when a current is passed through\\nit, attracts a small piece of iron fixed to one end of a\\npivoted lever. The other end of this lever moves between\\ntwo stops. At the transmitting station the operator closes\\na battery circuit by pressing a key, when the electro-magnet\\nof the sounder at the receiving station attracts the iron,\\nand the lever flies from one stop to the other with a sharp\\nclick, returning again as soon as the circuit is broken. A\\ndot is signalled when the lever falls back immediately after\\nthe click, and a dash when it makes a short stay before\\nreturning. Fig. 28 shows the code of signals for the\\nMorse telegraph.',\n",
       " 'In passing through a very long wire an electric current\\nbecomes greatly reduced in strength owing to the resistance\\nof the wire. If two telegraph stations are a great distance\\napart the energy of the current thus may be unequal to the\\ntask of making the electro-magnet move the lever of the\\nsounder so as to produce a click, but this difficulty is overcome\\nby the use of an ingenious arrangement called a\\n“relay.” It consists of a very small electro-magnet which134\\nattracts a light bar, the movement of the bar being made\\nto close the circuit of another battery at the receiving\\nstation. The feeble current works the relay, and the\\ncurrent in the local circuit operates the sounder.',\n",
       " 'The word “telegraph,” which is derived from the Greek\\ntele, far off, and grapho, I write, strictly signifies writing at\\na distance. The needle instrument and the sounder do not\\nwrite in any way, but by modifying the construction of the\\nsounder it can be made to record the messages it receives.\\nA small wheel is fitted to the free end of the lever of the\\nsounder, and an ink-well is placed so that the wheel dips\\ninto it when the lever is in the normal position. When\\nthe circuit is closed the lever moves just as in the ordinary\\nsounder, but instead of clicking against a stop it presses\\nthe inked wheel against a paper ribbon which is kept\\nslowly moving forward by clockwork. In this way the\\nwheel continues to mark a line along the paper as long as\\nthe circuit remains closed, and according to the time the\\ntransmitting key is kept down a short mark or dot, or a\\nlong mark or dash, is produced. The clockwork which\\nmoves the paper ribbon is started automatically by the\\ncurrent, and it continues working until the message is\\nfinished.',\n",
       " 'A good Morse operator can maintain a speed of about\\nthirty words a minute, but this is far too slow for certain\\nkinds of telegraphic work, such as the transmission of press\\nnews, and for such work the Wheatstone automatic transmitter\\nis used. First of all the messages are punched on\\na paper ribbon. This is done by passing the ribbon from\\nright to left by clockwork through a punching machine\\nwhich is provided with three keys, one for dots, one for\\ndashes, and the other for spaces. If the left-hand key is\\npressed, two holes opposite to one another are made,\\nrepresenting a dot; and if the right-hand key is pressed,136\\ntwo diagonal holes are punched, representing a dash. In\\nFig. 29, which shows a piece of ribbon punched in this\\nway, a third line of holes will be noticed between the outside\\nholes representing the dots and dashes. These holes\\nare for the purpose of guiding the paper ribbon steadily\\nalong through the transmitting machine. The punched\\nribbon is then drawn by clockwork through a Wheatstone\\ntransmitter. In this machine two oscillating needles, connected\\nwith one pole of a battery, are placed below the\\nmoving ribbon. Each time a hole passes, these needles\\nmake contact with a piece of metal connected with the\\nother pole of the battery, thus making and breaking the\\ncircuit with much greater rapidity than is possible with\\nthe Morse key. At the receiving station the messages are\\nrecorded by a form of Morse inker, coming out in dots and\\ndashes as though sent by hand. Below the punched ribbon\\nin Fig. 29 is shown the corresponding arrangement of dots\\nand dashes. The same punched ribbon may be used\\nrepeatedly when the message has to be sent on a number\\nof different lines. The Wheatstone automatic machine is\\ncapable of transmitting at the rate of from 250 to 400\\nwords a minute. Fig. 29 is a fragment of a Daily\\nTelegraph Balkan War special, as transmitted to the\\nYorkshire Post over the latter’s private wire from London\\nto Leeds. In the translation it will be seen that many\\ncommon words are abbreviated.',\n",
       " 'One weak point of telegraphy with Wheatstone instruments\\nis that the messages are received in Morse\\ncode, and have to be translated. During recent years\\ntelegraphs have been invented which actually produce\\ntheir messages in ordinary written or printed characters.\\nA very ingenious instrument is the Hughes printing\\ntelegraph, which turns out messages in typewritten form.\\nIts mechanism is too complicated to be described here,137\\nbut in general it consists of a transmitter having a keyboard\\nsomething like that of a typewriter, by means of\\nwhich currents of electricity are made to press a sheet of\\npaper at the right instant against a revolving type-wheel\\nbearing the various characters. This telegraph has been\\nmodified and brought to considerable perfection, and in\\none form or another it is used in European countries and\\nin the United States.',\n",
       " 'In the Pollak-Virag system of telegraphy the action of\\nlight upon sensitized photographic paper is utilized. An\\noperator punches special groupings of holes on a paper\\nribbon about 1 inch wide, by means of a perforating\\nmachine resembling a typewriter, and the ribbon is then\\npassed through a machine which transmits by brush contacts.\\nThe receiver consists of a very small mirror\\nconnected to two vibrating diaphragms, which control its\\nmovements according to the currents received, one diaphragm\\nmoving the mirror in a vertical direction, and the\\nother in a horizontal direction. The mirror reflects a ray\\nof light on to photographic bromide paper in the form of a\\nmoving band about 3 inches in width, and the combined\\naction of the two diaphragms makes the mirror move so\\nthat the ray of light traces out the messages in ordinary\\nalphabetical characters. As it moves forward after being\\nacted upon by the light, the paper is automatically developed\\nand fixed, and then passed through drying rollers. Although\\nthe writing is rather imperfect in formation it is quite legible\\nenough for most messages, but trouble occasionally occurs\\nwith messages containing figures, owing to confusion arising\\nfrom the similarity of the figures, 3, 5, and 8. The whole\\nprocess is carried out with such rapidity that 40,000 or\\neven more words can be transmitted easily in an hour.',\n",
       " 'One of the most remarkable of present-day telegraphs\\nis the Creed high-speed automatic printing telegraph.138\\nThis has been devised to do away with hand working as\\nfar as possible, and to substitute quicker and more accurate\\nautomatic methods. In this system a perforated paper\\ntape is produced by a keyboard perforator at the sending\\nstation. This tape is just ordinary Wheatstone tape, its\\nperforations representing in the Morse code the message to\\nbe transmitted; and the main advantage of the Creed perforator\\nover the three-key punching machine already\\ndescribed lies in the ease and speed with which it can be\\nworked. The keyboard contains a separate key for each\\nletter or signal of the Morse code, and the pressing of any\\nkey brings into operation certain punches which make the\\nperforations corresponding to that particular letter. The\\nperforator can be worked by any one who understands how\\nto use an ordinary typewriter, and a speed of about 60\\nwords a minute can be maintained by a fairly skilful\\noperator. If desired a number of tapes may be perforated\\nat the same time.',\n",
       " 'The tape prepared in this way is passed through a\\nWheatstone transmitter, and long or short currents, according\\nto the arrangement of the perforations, are sent out\\nalong the telegraph line. At the receiving station these\\nsignals operate a receiving perforator. This machine\\nproduces another perforated tape, which is an exact copy\\nof the tape at the sending station, and it turns out this\\nduplicate tape at the rate of from 150 to 200 words a\\nminute. There are two forms of this receiving perforator,\\none worked entirely by electricity, and the other by a combination\\nof electricity and compressed air, both forms\\nserving the same purpose. The duplicate tape is then\\npassed through an automatic printer, which reproduces the\\nmessage in large Roman characters on a paper tape. The\\nprinter works at a speed of from 80 to about 100 words a\\nminute, and the printed tape is pasted on a telegraphic139\\nform by a semi-automatic process, and the message is then\\nready for delivery. Plate XI. shows a specimen of the\\ntape from the receiving perforator, and the corresponding\\ntranslation as turned out by the printer. This message\\nformed part of a leading article in the Daily Mail. Some\\nidea of the wonderful capabilities of the Creed system may\\nbe gained from the fact that by means of it practically the\\nwhole contents of the Daily Mail are telegraphed every\\nnight from London to Manchester and Paris, for publication\\nnext morning.',\n",
       " 'One of the most remarkable features about present-day\\ntelegraphy is the ease with which two or more messages\\ncan be sent simultaneously over one line. Duplex telegraphy,\\nor the simultaneous transmission of two separate\\nmessages in opposite directions over one wire, is now\\npractised on almost every line of any importance. At first\\nsight duplex telegraphy seems to be an impossibility, for if\\nwe have two stations, one at each end of a single wire, and\\neach station fitted with a transmitter and a receiver, it\\nappears as if each transmitter would affect not only the\\nreceiver at the opposite end of the wire, but also the\\nreceiver at its own end, thus causing hopeless confusion\\nwhen both transmitters were in use at the same time.\\nThis actually would be the case with ordinary telegraphic\\nmethods, but by the use of a special arrangement all confusion\\nin working is avoided.',\n",
       " 'We have seen that a magnetic needle is deflected by a\\ncurrent passing through a coil of wire placed round it, and\\nthat the direction in which the needle is deflected depends\\nupon the direction of the current in the coil. Now suppose\\nwe place round the needle two coils of wire, wound so that\\nthe current in one flows in a direction opposite to that of\\nthe current in the other. Then, if we pass two equal\\ncurrents, one through each coil, it is evident that they will140\\nneutralize one another, so that the needle will not be\\ndeflected at all. In a duplex system one end of one of\\nthese coils is connected to earth, say to a copper plate\\nburied in the ground, and one end of the other to the line\\nwire. The two remaining ends are arranged as branches\\nleading off from a single wire connected with the transmitting\\nkey. The whole arrangement of coils and needle\\nis repeated at the other end of the line. If now the\\ntransmitting key at station A is pressed, the circuit is closed\\nand a current flows along the single wire, and then divides\\ninto two where the wire branches, half of it taking the path\\nthrough one coil and half the path through the other.\\nEqual currents thus flow through the oppositely wound\\ncoils, and the needle at station A is not deflected. Leaving\\nthe coils, one of these equal currents flows away to earth,\\nwhile the other passes out along the line wire. On its\\narrival at station B the current is able to pass through only\\none of the coils round the needle, and consequently the\\nneedle is deflected and the signal given. In this way the\\ntransmitting operator at station A is able to signal to station\\nB without affecting the receiver at his own end, and\\nsimilarly the operator at station B can transmit to A without\\naffecting the B receiver. Thus there can be no confusion\\nwhether the transmitters are worked at different times or\\nsimultaneously, for each transmitter affects only the\\nreceiver at the opposite end of the line. The diagram in\\nFig. 30 will help to make clearer the general principle.\\nK and K¹ are the two transmitting keys which close the\\ncircuit, and C and C¹ are the points at which the current\\ndivides into two. Instead of coils and needles, electro-magnets\\noperating sounders may be used, such magnets\\nhaving two separate and oppositely wound coils, acting in\\nexactly the same way as the coils round the needles. The\\nabove description is of course only a rough outline of the141\\nmethod, and in practice matters are more complicated,\\nowing to the necessity for carefully adjusted resistances and\\nfor condensers. There is also another and different method\\nof duplexing a line, but we have not space to describe it.\\nDuplex telegraphy requires two operators at each end of\\nthe line, one to send and the other to receive.',\n",
       " 'Diplex telegraphy is the simultaneous transmission of\\ntwo separate messages in the same direction over one line.\\nWithout going into details it may be said that for this\\npurpose two different transmitting keys are required, one of\\nwhich alters the direction, and the other the strength of the\\ncurrent though the line wire. The receivers are arranged\\nso that one responds only to a strong current, and the other\\nonly to a current in one particular direction. A line also\\nmay be quadruplexed, so that it is possible to transmit\\nsimultaneously two messages from each end, four operators\\nbeing required at each station, two to transmit and two\\nto receive. Systems of multiplex telegraphy have been\\ndevised by which very large numbers of messages can be\\nsent at once over a single wire, and the Baudot multiplex\\ntelegraph has proved very successful.',\n",
       " 'The wires for telegraphic purposes may be conveyed\\neither above or below the ground. Overground wires are142\\ncarried on poles by means of insulators of porcelain or other\\nnon-conducting material, protected by a sort of overhanging\\nscreen. The wires are left bare, and they are generally\\nmade of copper, but iron is used in some cases. In underground\\nlines the wires formerly were insulated by a covering\\nof gutta-percha, but now paper is generally used. Several\\nwires, each covered loosely with thoroughly dry paper, are\\nlaid together in a bundle, the whole bundle or cable being\\nenclosed in a strong lead pipe. The paper coverings are\\nmade to fit loosely so that the wires are surrounded by an\\ninsulating layer of dry air. As many as 1200 separate\\nwires are sometimes enclosed in one pipe. In order to\\nkeep telegraph lines in working order frequent tests are\\nnecessary, and the most important British Postal Telegraph\\nlines are tested once a week between 7.30 and 7.45 a.m.\\nThe earth is generally used for the return circuit in\\ntelegraphy, and the ends of the return wires are connected\\neither to metal plates buried in the ground to a depth at\\nwhich the earth is permanently moist, or to iron gas or\\nwater pipes. The current for telegraph working on a small\\nscale is usually supplied by primary cells, the Daniell cell\\nbeing a favourite for this purpose. In large offices the\\ncurrent is generally taken from a battery of storage cells.',\n",
       " 'During the early days of telegraphy, overhead lines\\nwere a source of considerable danger when thunderstorms\\nwere taking place. Lightning flashes often completely\\nwrecked the instruments, giving severe shocks to those in\\nthe vicinity, and in a few cases operators were killed at\\ntheir posts. Danger of this kind is now obviated by the\\nuse of contrivances known as lightning arresters. There\\nare several forms of these, but only one need be mentioned.\\nThe main features of this are two metal plates separated\\nslightly from one another, so that there is a small air gap\\nbetween them. One plate is connected to the line wire,143\\nand the other to earth. Almost all lightning flashes consist\\nof an oscillatory discharge, that is one which passes a\\nnumber of times backwards and forwards between a cloud\\nand the earth. A very rapidly alternating discharge of\\nthis kind finds difficulty in passing along the line wire,\\nbeing greatly impeded by the coils of wire in the various\\npieces of apparatus; and although the resistance of this\\nair gap is very high, the lightning discharge will cross the\\ngap sooner than struggle along the line wire. In this way,\\nwhen a flash affects the line, the discharge jumps the gap\\nbetween the plates of the arrester and passes away harmlessly\\nto earth, without entering the telegraph office at all.\\nAs was mentioned in Chapter III., the prevalence of\\nmagnetic storms sometimes renders telegraph lines quite\\nunworkable for a time, but although such disturbances\\ncause great delay and general inconvenience, they are not\\nlikely to be at all dangerous. It is often possible to\\nmaintain telegraphic communication during magnetic disturbances\\nby using two lines to form a complete metallic\\nloop, so that there is no earth return.',\n",
       " 'The story of submarine telegraphy is a wonderful record\\nof dogged perseverance in the face of tremendous obstacles\\nand disastrous failures. It would be of no interest to trace\\nthe story to its very beginning, and so we will commence\\nwith the laying of the first cable across the English\\nChannel from Dover to Calais, in 1850. A single copper\\nwire covered with a layer of gutta-percha half an inch thick\\nwas used, and leaden weights were attached to it at intervals\\nof one hundred yards, the fixing of each weight necessitating\\nthe stoppage of the cable-laying ship. The line was laid\\nsuccessfully, but it failed after working for a single day, and\\nit afterwards turned out that a Boulogne fisherman had\\nhauled up the cable with his trawl. This line proved that\\ntelegraphic communication between England and France\\nwas possible, but the enterprise was assailed with every\\nimaginable kind of abuse and ridicule. It is said that some\\npeople really believed that the cable was worked in the\\nstyle of the old-fashioned house bell, and that the signals\\nwere given by pulling the wire! In the next year another\\nattempt was made by Mr. T.\\xa0R. Crampton, a prominent\\nrailway engineer, who himself contributed half of the\\n£15,000 required. The form of cable adopted by him\\nconsisted of four copper wires, each covered with two layers\\nof gutta-percha, and the four enclosed in a covering formed\\nof ten galvanized iron wires wound spirally round them.145\\nThe line proved a permanent success, and this type of\\ncable, with certain modifications, is still in use. In 1852\\nthree attempts were made to connect England and Ireland,\\nbut the first two failed owing to the employment of cables\\ntoo light to withstand the strong tidal currents, and the\\nthird was somehow mismanaged as regards the paying-out,\\nso that there was not enough cable to reach across. A\\nheavier cable was tried in the next year, and this was a\\nlasting success.',\n",
       " 'The success of these two cables led to the laying of\\nmany other European cables over similar distances, but we\\nmust now pass on to a very much bigger undertaking, the\\nlaying of the Atlantic cable.

Brett, C.\\xa0T. Bright, and C.\\xa0W. Field. The British\\nand the United States Governments granted a subsidy, in\\nreturn for which Government messages were to have\\npriority over all others, and were to be transmitted free.\\nThe objections launched against the scheme were of course\\nmany, some of them making very amusing reading.

It was now decided\\nto use only one vessel for laying the cable, and the Great\\nEastern was chosen for the task. This vessel had been\\nlying idle for close on ten years, owing to her failure as a\\ncargo boat, but her great size and capacity made her most\\nsuitable for carrying the enormous weight of the whole\\ncable. In July 1865 the Great Eastern set sail, under\\nthe escort of two British warships. When 84 miles had\\nbeen paid out, a fault occurred, and after drawing up about\\n10½ miles it was found that a piece of iron wire had pierced\\nthe coating of the cable. The trouble was put right, and\\nthe paying-out continued successfully until over 700 miles\\nhad been laid, when another fault appeared. The cable\\nwas again drawn in until the fault was reached, and\\nanother piece of iron was found piercing clean through.149\\nIt was evident that two such pieces of iron could not have\\ngot there by accident, and there was no doubt that they\\nhad been inserted intentionally by some malicious scoundrel,\\nmost likely with the object of affecting the company’s\\nshares. A start was made once more, and all went well\\nuntil about two-thirds of the distance had been covered,\\nwhen the cable broke and had to be abandoned after\\nseveral nearly successful attempts to recover it.',\n",
       " 'In spite of the loss, which amounted to £600,000, the\\nenergetic promoters contrived to raise fresh capital, and in\\n1866 the Great Eastern started again. This effort was\\ncompletely successful, and on 28th July 1866 the cable\\nwas landed amidst great rejoicing. The following extracts\\nfrom the diary of the engineer Sir Daniell Gooch, give us\\nsome idea of the landing.',\n",
       " '“Is it wrong that I should have felt as though my\\nheart would burst when that end of our long line touched\\nthe shore amid the booming of cannon, the wild, half-mad\\ncheers and shouts of the men?... I am given a never-dying\\nthought; that I aided in laying the Atlantic cable....\\nThe old cable hands seemed as though they could\\neat the end; one man actually put it into his mouth and\\nsucked it. They held it up and danced round it, cheering\\nat the top of their voices. It was a strange sight, nay, a\\nsight that filled our eyes with tears.... I did cheer, but\\nI could better have silently cried.”',\n",
       " 'This time the cable was destined to have a long and\\nuseful life, and later in the same year the 1865 cable was\\nrecovered, spliced to a new length, and safely brought to\\nland, so that there were now two links between the Old\\nWorld and the New. It was estimated that the total cost\\nof completing the great undertaking, including the cost of\\nthe unsuccessful attempts, was nearly two and a half millions\\nsterling. Since 1866 cable-laying has proceeded very150\\nrapidly, and to-day telegraphic communication exists between\\nalmost all parts of the civilized world. According\\nto recent statistics, the North Atlantic Ocean is now\\ncrossed by no less than 17 cables, the number of cables\\nall over the world being 2937, with a total length of\\n291,137 nautical miles.',\n",
       " 'Before describing the actual working of a submarine\\ncable, a few words on cable-laying may be of interest.\\nBefore the cable-ship starts, another vessel is sent over\\nthe proposed course to make soundings. Galvanized steel\\npianoforte wire is used for sounding, and it is wound in\\nlengths of 3 or 4 nautical miles on gun-metal drums.\\nThe drums are worked by an engine, and the average\\nspeed of working is somewhere about 100 fathoms a\\nminute in descending, and 70 fathoms a minute in picking\\nup. Some idea of the time occupied may be gained from\\na sounding in the Atlantic Ocean which registered a depth\\nof 3233 fathoms, or nearly 3½ miles. The sinker took\\nthirty-three minutes fifty seconds in descending, and forty-five\\nminutes were taken in picking up. The heavy sinker\\nis not brought up with the line, but is detached from the\\nsounder by an ingenious contrivance and left at the bottom.\\nThe sounder is fitted with an arrangement to bring up a\\nspecimen of the bottom, and also a sample of water; and\\nthe temperature at any depth is ascertained by self-registering\\nthermometers.',\n",
       " 'When the soundings are complete the cable-ship takes\\nup her task. The cable is coiled in tanks on board, and\\nis kept constantly under water to prevent injury to the\\ngutta-percha insulation by overheating. As each section\\nis placed in the tank, the ends of it are led to a test-box,\\nand labelled so that they can be easily recognized. Insulated\\nwires run from the test-box to instruments in the\\ntesting-room, so that the electrical condition of the whole151\\ncable is constantly under observation. During the whole\\ntime the cable is being laid its insulation is tested continuously,\\nand at intervals of five minutes signals are sent from\\nthe shore end to the ship, so that a fault is instantly detected.\\nThe cable in its tank is eased out by a number of\\nmen, and mechanics are posted at the cable drums and\\nbrakes, while constant streams of water cool the cable and\\nthe bearings and surfaces of the brakes. The tension, as\\nshown by the dynamometer, is at all times under careful\\nobservation. When it becomes necessary to wind back the\\ncable on account of some fault, cuts are made at intervals\\nof a quarter or half a mile, tests being made at each cutting\\nuntil the fault is localized in-board. As soon as the cable\\nout-board is found “O.K.,” the ends are spliced up and the\\npaying-out begins again. If the cable breaks from any\\ncause, a mark-buoy is lowered instantly on the spot, and\\nthe cable is grappled for. This may take a day or two in\\ngood weather, but a delay of weeks may be caused by bad\\nweather, which makes grappling impossible.',\n",
       " 'The practical working of a submarine cable differs in\\nmany respects from that of a land telegraph line. The\\ncurrents used in submarine telegraphy are extremely small,\\ncontrary to the popular impression. An insulated cable\\nacts like a Leyden jar, in the sense that it accumulates\\nelectricity and does not quickly part with it, as does a bare\\noverhead wire. In the case of a very long cable, such as\\none across the Atlantic, a current continues to flow from it\\nfor some time after the battery is disconnected. A second\\nsignal cannot be sent until the electricity is dissipated and\\nthe cable clear, and if a powerful current were employed\\nthe time occupied in this clearing would be considerable, so\\nthat the speed of signalling would be slow. Another\\nobjection to a powerful current is that if any flaw\\nexists in the insulation of the cable, such a current is apt152\\nto increase the flaw, and finally cause the breakdown of\\nthe line.',\n",
       " 'The feebleness of the currents in submarine telegraphy\\nmakes it impossible to use the ordinary land telegraph\\nreceiver, and a more sensitive instrument known as the\\n“mirror receiver” is used. This consists of a coil of very\\nfine wire, in the centre of which a tiny magnetic needle is\\nsuspended by a fibre of unspun silk. A magnet placed close\\nby keeps the needle in one position when no current is\\nflowing. As the deflections of the needle are extremely\\nsmall, it is necessary to magnify them in some way, and\\nthis is done by fixing to the needle a very small mirror,\\nupon which falls a ray of light from a lamp. The mirror\\nreflects this ray on to a sheet of white paper marked with\\na scale, and as the mirror moves along with the needle the\\npoint of light travels over the paper, a very small movement\\nof the needle causing the light to travel some inches.\\nThe receiving operator sits in a darkened room and\\nwatches the light, which moves to the right or to the left\\naccording to the direction of the current. The signals\\nemployed are the same as those for the single-needle\\ninstrument, a movement to the left indicating a dot, and\\none to the right a dash. In many instruments the total\\nweight of magnet and mirror is only two or three grains,\\nand the sensitiveness is such that the current from a voltaic\\ncell consisting of a lady’s silver thimble with a few drops of\\nacidulated water and a diminutive rod of zinc, is sufficient\\nto transmit a message across the Atlantic.',\n",
       " 'The mirror receiver cannot write down its messages,\\nand for recording purposes an instrument invented by Lord\\nKelvin, and called the “siphon recorder,” is used. In this\\ninstrument a coil of wire is suspended between the poles of\\nan electro-magnet, and to it is connected by means of a silk\\nfibre a delicate glass tube or siphon. One end of the153\\nsiphon dips into an ink-well, and capillary attraction causes\\nthe ink to fill the siphon. The other end of the siphon\\nalmost touches a moving paper ribbon placed beneath it.\\nThe ink and the paper are oppositely electrified, and the\\nattraction between the opposite charges causes the ink to\\nspurt out of the siphon in very minute drops, which fall on\\nto the paper. As long as no current is passing the siphon\\nremains stationary, but when a current flows from the cable\\nthrough the coil, the latter moves to one side or the other,\\naccording to the direction of the current, and makes the\\nsiphon move also. Consequently, instead of a straight line\\nalong the middle of the paper ribbon, a wavy line with\\nlittle peaks on each side of the centre is produced by the\\nminute drops of ink. This recorder sometimes refuses to\\nwork properly in damp weather, owing to the loss of the\\nopposite charges on ink and paper, but a later inventor,\\nnamed Cuttriss, has removed this trouble by using a siphon\\nkept constantly in vibration by electro-magnetism. The\\nordinary single-needle code is used for the siphon recorder.',\n",
       " 'In our younger days most of us have amused ourselves\\nwith a toy telephone consisting of a long piece of string\\nhaving each end passed through the bottom of a little cardboard\\nbox, and secured by a knot. If the string is stretched\\ntightly this arrangement enables whispered words to be\\nheard at a distance of 20 or 30 yards. Simple as is\\nthis little toy, yet it is probable that many people would\\nbe rather nonplussed if asked suddenly to explain how the\\nsounds travel along the string from one box to the other.\\nIf the toy had some complicated mechanism most likely\\nevery one would want to know how it worked, but the whole\\nthing is so extremely simple that generally it is dismissed\\nwithout a thought.',\n",
       " 'If we strike a tuning-fork and then hold it close to the\\near, we hear that it produces a sound, and at the same time,\\nfrom a slight sensation in the hand, we become aware that\\nthe fork is in vibration. As the fork vibrates it disturbs\\nthe tiny particles of air round it and sets them vibrating,\\nand these vibrations are communicated from one particle to\\nanother until they reach the drum of the ear, when that also\\nbegins to vibrate and we hear a sound. This is only\\nanother way of saying that the disturbances of the air\\ncaused by the vibrations of the tuning-fork are propagated\\nin a series of waves, which we call “sound waves.” Sound is\\ntransmitted better through liquids than through the air, and155\\nbetter still through solids, and this is why words spoken so\\nsoftly as to be inaudible through the air at a distance of,\\nsay, 100 feet, can be heard fairly distinctly at that distance\\nby means of the string telephone. The sound reaches us\\nalong the string in exactly the same way as through the air,\\nthat is, by means of minute impulses passed on from particle\\nto particle.',\n",
       " 'A more satisfactory arrangement than the string telephone\\nconsists of two thin plates of metal connected by a\\nwire which is stretched very tightly. Words spoken close\\nto one plate are heard by a listener at the other plate up to\\na considerable distance. Let us try to see exactly what\\ntakes place when this apparatus is used. In the act of\\nspeaking, vibrations are set up in the air, and these in turn\\nset up vibrations in the metal plate. The vibrations are\\nthen communicated to the wire and to the metal plate at\\nthe other end, and finally the vibrations of this plate produce\\nvibrations in the air between the plate and the listener,\\nand the sound reaches the ear.',\n",
       " 'This simple experiment shows the remarkable fact that\\na plate of metal is able to reproduce faithfully all the vibrations\\ncommunicated to it by the human voice, and from this\\nfact it follows that if we can communicate the vibrations set\\nup in one plate by the voice, to another plate at a distance\\nof 100 miles, we shall be able to speak to a listener\\nat the further plate just as if he were close to us. A\\nstretched string or wire transmits the vibrations fairly well\\nup to a certain distance, but beyond this distance the vibrations\\nbecome weaker and weaker until no sound at all\\nreaches the air. By the aid of electricity, however, we can\\ntransmit the vibrations to a tremendous distance, the range\\nbeing limited only by the imperfections of our apparatus.',\n",
       " 'The first attempt at the construction of an electric\\ntelephone, that is an instrument by means of which the156\\nvibrations set up by the voice or by a musical instrument\\nare transmitted by electricity, was made in 1860 by Johann\\nPhilipp Reis, a teacher in a school at Friedrichsdorf, in\\nGermany. His transmitting apparatus consisted of a box\\nhaving a hole covered by a tightly stretched membrane, to\\nwhich was attached a little strip of platinum. When the\\nmembrane was made to vibrate by sounds produced close\\nto the box, the strip of platinum moved to and fro against\\na metal tip, which closed the circuit of a battery. The\\nreceiver was a long needle of soft iron round which was\\nwound a coil of wire, and the ends of the needle rested on\\ntwo little bridges of a sounding box. The vibrations of\\nthe membrane opened and closed the circuit at a great\\nspeed, and the rapid magnetization of the needle produced\\na tone of the same pitch as the one which set the membrane\\nvibrating. This apparatus transmitted musical sounds and\\nmelodies with great accuracy, but there is considerable\\ndifference of opinion as to whether it was able to transmit\\nspeech. Professor Sylvanus Thompson distinctly states\\nthat Reis’s telephone could and did transmit speech, but\\nother experts dispute the fact. We probably shall be quite\\nsafe in concluding that this telephone did transmit speech,\\nbut very imperfectly. In any case it is certain that the\\nreceiver of this apparatus is not based on the same principle\\nas the modern telephone receiver.',\n",
       " 'Some years later Graham Bell, Professor of Vocal\\nPhysiology in the University of Boston, turned his attention\\nto the electric transmission of speech, probably being led to\\ndo so from his experiments in teaching the deaf and dumb.\\nHis apparatuses shown at an exhibition in Philadelphia in\\n1876, consisted of a tube having one end open for speaking\\ninto, and the other closed by a tightly stretched membrane\\nto which was attached a very light steel bar magnet. The\\nvibrations set up in the membrane by the voice made the157\\nlittle magnet move to and fro in front of the poles of an\\nelectro-magnet, inserted in a battery circuit, thus inducing\\ncurrents of electricity in the coils of the latter magnet.\\nThe currents produced in this way varied in direction and\\nstrength according to the vibratory movements of the\\nmembrane, and being transmitted along a wire they\\nproduced similar variations in current in another electro-magnet\\nin the receiver. The currents produced in this\\nmanner in the receiver set up vibrations in a metal\\ndiaphragm in front of the magnet poles, and so the words\\nspoken into the transmitter were reproduced.',\n",
       " 'Since the year 1876 the telephone has developed with\\nremarkable rapidity, and an attempt to trace its growth\\nwould involve a series of detailed descriptions of closely\\nsimilar inventions which would be quite uninteresting to\\nmost readers. Now, therefore, that we have introduced\\nthe instruments, and seen something of its principle and\\nits early forms, it will be most satisfactory to omit the\\nintermediate stages and to go on to the telephone as used\\nin recent years. The first telephone to come into general\\nuse was the invention of Graham Bell, and was an improved\\nform of his early instrument just described. A case or\\ntube of ebonite, which forms the handle of the instrument,\\ncontains a steel bar magnet having a small coil of insulated\\nwire at the end nearest the mouthpiece of the tube, the\\nends of the coil passing along the tube to be connected to\\nthe line wires. Close to the coil end of the magnet, and\\nbetween it and the mouthpiece, is fixed a diaphragm of\\nthin sheet-iron. A complete outfit consists of two of these\\ninstruments connected by wires, and it will be noticed that\\nno battery is employed.',\n",
       " 'The air vibrations set up by the voice make the\\ndiaphragm vibrate also, so that it moves backwards and\\nforwards. These movements are infinitesimally small, but158\\nthey are sufficient to affect the lines of force of the magnet\\nto such an extent that rapidly alternating currents of varying\\ndegrees of strength are set up in the coil and sent along\\nthe line wire. On arriving at the receiver these currents\\npass through the coil and produce rapid variations in the\\nstrength of the magnet, so that instead of exerting a\\nuniform attraction upon the iron diaphragm, the magnet\\npulls it with constantly varying force, and thus sets it\\nvibrating. The air in front of the diaphragm now begins\\nto vibrate, and the listener hears a reproduction of the\\nwords spoken into the transmitter. The way in which the\\nfluctuations of the current make the second diaphragm\\nvibrate exactly in accordance with the first is very remarkable,\\nand it is important to notice that the listener does not\\nhear the actual voice of the speaker, but a perfect reproduction\\nof it; in fact, the second diaphragm speaks.',\n",
       " 'The reader probably will be surprised to be told that\\nthe transmitter and the receiver of a magneto-electric\\ntelephone are respectively a dynamo and electric motor of\\nminute proportions. We provide a dynamo with mechanical\\nmotion and it gives us electric current, and by sending\\nthis current through an electric motor we get mechanical\\nmotion back again. In the transmitter of the telephone\\njust described, the mechanical motion is in the form of\\nvibrations of the metal diaphragm, which set up currents of\\nelectricity in the coil of wire round the magnet, so that the\\ntransmitter is really a tiny dynamo driven by the voice.\\nThe receiver is provided with electric current from the\\ntransmitter, and it converts this into mechanical motion in\\nthe diaphragm, so that the receiver is a little electric motor.',\n",
       " 'Transmitters of the type just described work well over\\nshort distances, but the currents they produce are too feeble\\nfor transmission over a very long wire, and on this account\\nthey have been superseded by transmitters on the microphone159\\nprinciple. A microphone is an instrument for\\nmaking extremely small sounds plainly audible. If a\\ncurrent is passed through a box containing loose bits of\\nbroken carbon, it meets with great resistance, but if the\\nbits of carbon are compressed their conducting power is\\nconsiderably increased. Even such slight differences in\\npressure as are produced by vibrating the box will affect\\nthe amount of current passing through the carbon. If this\\ncurrent is led by wires to an ordinary telephone receiver\\nthe arrangement becomes a simple form of microphone.\\nThe vibrations of the box vary\\nthe resistance of the carbon,\\nand the corresponding variations\\nin the current set up\\nvibrations in the receiver, but\\nin a magnified form. The\\nsmallest sound vibrations alter\\nthe resistance of the carbon,\\nand as these vibrations are\\nmagnified in the receiver, the\\nreproduced sound is magnified\\nalso. The footsteps of a fly\\nmay be heard quite distinctly by means of a good microphone,\\nand the ticks of a watch sound like the strokes of a\\nhammer.',\n",
       " 'By means of this power of magnifying vibrations a\\nmicrophone transmitter can be used on a line of tremendous\\nlength, where an ordinary Bell transmitter would be utterly\\nuseless. The general features of this transmitter, Fig. 31,\\nare a diaphragm and a block of carbon separated slightly\\nfrom one another, the intervening space being filled with\\ngranules of carbon. These are enclosed in a case of\\nebonite having a mouthpiece in front and two terminals\\nbehind, one terminal being connected with the carbon block160\\nand the other with the diaphragm. From these terminals\\nwires are led to a battery and to the receiver, which is of\\nthe Bell type. The current has to pass through the carbon\\ngranules, and the movements of the diaphragm when set in\\nvibration by the voice vary the pressure upon the granules,\\nand in this way set up variations in the current. Carbon\\ndust also may be used instead of granular carbon, and then the\\ninstrument is called a “dust transmitter.”',\n",
       " 'It is usual to have a transmitter and\\na receiver on one handle for the greater\\nconvenience of the user. The arrangement\\nis shown in Fig. 32, and it will be\\nseen that when the user places the receiver\\nto his ear the transmitting mouthpiece is\\nin position for speaking. The microphone\\nwith its carbon dust is placed at A, just\\nbelow the mouthpiece, and the earpiece\\nor receiver B contains a little magnet and\\ncoil with a diaphragm in front, so that it\\nis really a Bell instrument. A little lever\\nwill be noticed at C. This is a switch\\nwhich brings the transmitter into circuit\\non being pressed with the finger.',\n",
       " 'It is now time to see something of the\\narrangement and working of telephone\\nsystems. As soon as the telephone became a commercially\\npracticable instrument the necessity for some means of\\ninter-communication became evident, and the telephone\\nexchange was brought into being. The first exchange\\nwas started in 1877, in Boston, but this was a very\\nsmall affair and it was run on very crude lines. When\\none subscriber wished to communicate with another he\\nhad to call up an operator, who received the message\\nand repeated it to the person for whom it was intended;161\\nthere was no direct communication between the various\\nsubscribers’ instruments. As the number of users increased\\nit became necessary to devise some system\\nwhereby each subscriber could call the attention of an\\noperator at the central station, and be put into direct\\ncommunication with any other subscriber without delay;\\nand the exchange system of to-day, which fulfils these\\nrequirements almost to perfection, is the result of gradual\\nimprovements in telephone methods extending over some\\nthirty-five years.',\n",
       " 'When a subscriber wishes to telephone, he first must\\ncall up the operator at the exchange. Until comparatively\\nrecently this was done by turning a handle placed at the\\nside of the instrument. This handle operated a little\\ndynamo, and the current produced caused a shutter at the\\nexchange to drop and reveal a number, just as in the\\nelectric bell indicator, so that the operator knew which\\ninstrument was calling. As soon as the operator answered\\nthe call, the shutter replaced itself automatically. The\\nsignal to disconnect was given in the same way, but the\\nindicator was of a different colour in order to prevent confusion\\nwith a call signal. These handle-operated telephones\\nare still in common use, but they are being replaced by\\ninstruments which do away with handle-turning on the\\npart of the subscriber, and with dropping shutters at the\\nexchange. In this latest system all that the subscriber has\\nto do is to lift his telephone from its rest, when a little\\nelectric lamp lights up at the exchange; and when he has\\nfinished his conversation he merely replaces the telephone,\\nand again a little lamp glows.',\n",
       " 'We must now see what happens at the exchange when\\na call is made. Each operator has control of a number of\\npairs of flexible cords terminating in plugs, the two cords\\nof each pair being electrically connected. The plugs rest162\\non a shelf in front of the operator, and the cords pass\\nthrough the shelf and hang down below it. If a plug is\\nlifted, the cord comes up through the shelf, and it is drawn\\nback again by a weight when the plug is not in use. Two\\nlamps are provided for each pair of cords, one being fixed\\nclose to each cord. The two wires leading from each\\nsubscriber’s instrument are connected to a little tube-shaped\\nswitch called a “jack,” and each jack has a lamp of its own.\\nWhen a subscriber lifts his telephone from its rest a lamp\\nglows, and the operator inserts one plug of a pair into the\\njack thus indicated, and the lamp goes out automatically.\\nShe then switches on her telephone to the caller and asks\\nfor the number of the subscriber to whom he wishes to\\nspeak; and as soon as she gets this she inserts the other\\nplug of the pair into the jack belonging to this number.\\nBy a simple movement she then rings up the required\\nperson by switching on the current to his telephone bell.',\n",
       " 'Here comes in the use of the two lamps connected with\\nthe cords. As long as the subscribers’ telephones are on\\ntheir rests the lamps are lighted, but as soon as they are\\nlifted off the lamps go out. The caller’s telephone is of\\ncourse off its rest, and so the lamp connected with the first\\ncord is not lit; but until the subscriber rung up lifts his\\ninstrument to answer the call, the lamp of the second cord\\nremains lit, having first lighted up when the plug was\\ninserted in the jack of his number. When the second\\nlamp goes out the operator knows that the call has been\\nresponded to, and that the two subscribers are in communication\\nwith each other. Having finished their conversation,\\nboth subscribers replace their instruments on the\\nrests, whereupon both lamps light up, informing the operator\\nthat she may disconnect by pulling out the plugs.',\n",
       " 'It is manifestly impossible for one operator to attend\\nto the calls of all the subscribers in the exchange, and so a163\\nnumber of operators are employed, each one having to\\nattend to the calls of a certain number of subscribers. At\\nthe same time it is clear that each operator may be called\\nupon to connect one of her subscribers to any other subscriber\\nin the whole exchange. In order to make this\\npossible the switchboard is divided into sections, each\\nhaving as many jacks as there are lines in the exchange, so\\nthat in this respect all the sections are multiples of each\\nother, and the whole arrangement is called a “multiple\\nswitchboard,” the repeated jacks being called “multiple\\njacks.” Then there are other jacks which it is not necessary\\nto duplicate. We have seen that when a subscriber calls the\\nexchange a lamp glows, and the operator inserts a plug into\\nthe jack beside the lamp, in order to answer the call and\\nascertain what number is required. These are called\\n“answering jacks,” and the lamp is the line signal. It is\\nusual to have three operators to each section of the switchboard,\\nand each operator has charge of so many answering\\njacks, representing so many subscribers. At the same\\ntime she has access to the whole section, so that she can\\nconnect any of her subscribers to any other line in the\\nexchange.',\n",
       " 'When a number is called for, the operator must be able\\nto tell at once whether the line is free or not. The jack\\nin her section may be unoccupied, but she must know also\\nwhether all the multiple jacks belonging to that number\\nare free, for an operator at another section may have\\nconnected the line to one of her subscribers. To enable\\nan operator to ascertain this quickly an electrical test is\\nprovided. When two lines are connected, the whole of the\\nmultiple jacks belonging to each are charged with electricity,\\nand if an operator at any section touches one of these jacks\\nwith a plug, a current through her receiver makes a click,\\nand on hearing the click she knows that the line is engaged.164\\nThe testing takes an extremely short time, and this is why a\\ncaller receives the reply, “Number engaged,” so promptly\\nthat he feels inclined to doubt whether the operator has\\nmade any attempt at all to connect him up to the number.',\n",
       " 'In order that an operator may have both hands free to\\nmanipulate the plugs, her telephone receiver is fixed over\\none ear by a fastening passing over her head, and the\\ntransmitter is hung from her shoulders so as to be close to\\nher mouth.',\n",
       " 'In telegraphy it is the rule to employ the earth for the\\nreturn part of the circuit, but this is not customary in\\ntelephony. The telephone is a much more sensitive\\ninstrument than the telegraph, and a telephone having an\\nearth return is subject to all kinds of strange and weird\\nnoises which greatly interfere with conversation. These\\nnoises may be caused by natural electrical disturbances, or\\nby the proximity of telegraph and other wires conveying\\nelectric currents. On this account telephone lines are\\nmade with a complete metallic circuit. As in telegraphy,\\nprotection from lightning flashes is afforded by lightning\\narresters. The current for the working of a telephone\\nexchange is supplied from a central battery of accumulators,\\nand also from dynamos.',\n",
       " 'Although the manual exchange telephone system of\\nto-day works with remarkable efficiency, it has certain\\nweak points. For instance, if an operator cares to do so,\\nshe can listen to conversations between subscribers, so\\nthat privacy cannot be assured. As a matter of fact, the\\noperators have little time for this kind of thing, at any rate\\nduring the busy hours of the day, and as a rule they are\\nnot sufficiently interested in other people’s affairs to make\\nany attempt to listen to their remarks. The male operators\\nwho work through the slack hours of the night are\\noccasionally guilty of listening. Some time ago the writer\\nhad to ring up a friend in the very early morning, and\\nduring the conversation this gentleman asked what time it\\nwas. Before the writer had time to get a word out, a deep\\nbass voice from the exchange replied, “Half-past two.”\\nLittle incidents of this sort remind one that it is not wise\\nto speak too freely by telephone. Then again operators are\\nliable to make wrong connexions through faulty hearing\\nof the number called for, and these are equally annoying to\\nthe caller and to the person rung up in mistake. Many\\nother defects might be mentioned, but these are sufficient\\nto show that the manual system is not perfect.',\n",
       " 'For a long time inventors have been striving to do\\naway with all such defects by abolishing the exchange\\noperators, and substituting mechanism to work the\\nexchanges automatically, and during the last few years the\\nsystem of the Automatic Electric Company, of Chicago,\\nhas been brought to great perfection. This system is in\\nextensive use in the United States, and is employed in\\ntwo or three exchanges in this country. Unfortunately\\nthe mechanism of this system is extremely complicated, so\\nthat it is impossible to describe it fully in a book of this\\nkind; but some idea of the method of working may be\\ngiven without entering into technical details.',\n",
       " 'Each subscriber’s telephone instrument is fitted with a\\ndial which turns round on a pivot at its centre. This dial\\nhas a series of holes round its circumference, numbered\\nconsecutively from 1 to 9, and 0. Suppose now a\\nsubscriber wishes to speak to a friend whose telephone\\nnumber is 2583. He removes the receiver from its hook,\\nplaces his finger in the hole marked 2, and turns the dial\\nround in a clockwise direction until his finger comes in\\ncontact with a stop. He then removes his finger, and the\\ndial automatically returns to its original position. He then\\nplaces his finger in the hole marked 5, and again turns the166\\ndial as far as the stop, and when the dial has returned to\\nthe normal position he repeats the process with his finger\\nplaced successively in the holes marked 8 and 3. He now\\nplaces the receiver to his ear, and by the time he has done\\nthis the automatic mechanism at the exchange has made\\nthe necessary connexions, and has rung the bell of\\nsubscriber number 2583. On completing the conversation\\neach subscriber returns his receiver to its hook, and the\\nexchange mechanism returns to its normal position.',\n",
       " 'The turning of the dial by the finger coils up a spring,\\nand this spring, acting along with a speed governor, makes\\nthe dial return to its first position at a certain definite\\nspeed as soon as the finger is removed. During this\\nretrograde movement a switch automatically sends out into\\nthe line a certain number of impulses, the number being\\ndetermined by the hole in which the finger is placed. In\\nthe case supposed, groups of two, five, eight, and three\\nimpulses respectively would be sent out, each group\\nseparated from the next by an interval during which the\\nsubscriber is turning the dial.',\n",
       " 'Now let us see what takes place at the exchange.\\nThe subscriber’s instrument is connected to a mechanical\\narrangement known as a “line switch.” This switch\\nis brought into play by the act of removing the receiver\\nfrom its hook, and it then automatically connects the\\nsubscriber’s line to what is called a “first selector” switch.\\nThe group of two impulses sent out by the first turning of\\nthe dial raises this first selector two steps, and it then\\nsweeps along a row of contacts connected to “trunks”\\ngoing to the 2000 section. Passing by occupied trunks, it\\nfinds an idle one, and so connects the line to an idle\\n“second selector.” This selector is operated by the second\\ngroup of impulses, five in number, and after being raised\\nfive steps it acts like the first selector, and finds an idle167\\ntrunk leading to the 2500 section. This places the caller’s\\nline in connexion with still another switch called a\\n“connector,” and this switch, operated by the remaining\\ngroups of eight and three impulses, finds the required tens\\nsection, and selects the third member of that section. If\\nthe number 2583 is disengaged, the connector switch now\\nsends current from the central battery to this instrument,\\nthus ringing its bell, and it also supplies speaking current\\nto the two lines during the conversation, restores the\\nexchange mechanism to its original condition as soon as\\nthe conversation is ended and the subscribers have hung\\nup their receivers, and registers the call on the calling\\nsubscriber’s meter. If the connector finds the number\\nengaged, it sends out an intermittent buzzing sound, to\\ninform the caller of the fact. All these operations take\\ntime to describe, even in outline, but in practice they are\\ncarried out with the utmost rapidity, each step in the connecting-up\\nprocess taking only a small fraction of a second.',\n",
       " 'For ordinary local calls the automatic system requires\\nno operators at all, but for the convenience of users there\\nare usually two clerks at the exchange, one to give\\nany information required by subscribers, and the other to\\nrecord complaints regarding faulty working. For trunk\\ncalls, the subscriber places his finger in the hole marked 0,\\nand gives the dial one turn. This connects him to an\\noperator at the trunk switchboard, who makes the required\\nconnexion and then calls him up in the usual way.',\n",
       " 'It might be thought that the complex mechanism of an\\nautomatic exchange would constantly be getting out of\\norder, but it is found to work with great smoothness.\\nEach automatic switchboard has a skilled electrician in\\nattendance, and he is informed instantly of any faulty\\nworking by means of supervisory lamps and other signals.\\nEven without these signals the attendant would be quickly168\\naware of any breakdown, for his ear becomes so accustomed\\nto the sounds made by the apparatus during the connecting-up,\\nthat any abnormal sound due to faulty connecting\\nattracts his attention at once.

It was evident that little\\nprogress could be made in this direction unless some means\\ncould be devised for neutralizing this capacity effect, as it170\\nis called, of the cable, and finally it was discovered that\\nthis could be done by inserting at intervals along the cable\\na number of coils of wire. These coils are known as “loading\\ncoils,” and a cable provided with them is called a “loaded\\ncable.” Such cables have been laid across various narrow\\nseas, such as between England and France, and England\\nand Ireland, and these have proved very successful for\\ntelephonic communication. The problem of transatlantic\\ntelephony however still remains to be solved. Experiments\\nhave been made in submarine telephony over a bare\\niron cable, instead of the usual insulated cable. Conversations\\nhave been carried on in this way without difficulty\\nbetween Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., and Vashon\\nIsland, a total distance of about 11 miles, and it is\\npossible that uninsulated cables may play an extremely\\nimportant part in the development of submarine telephony.',\n",

Several arrangements for overcoming\\nthis difficulty by means of automatic recording\\nmechanism have been invented, but the only really successful\\none is the telegraphone.',\n",
       " 'This instrument is the invention of Waldemar Poulsen,\\nwhose apparatus for wireless telegraphy we shall speak of\\nin the next chapter. The telegraphone performs at the\\nsame time the work of a telephone and of a phonograph.\\nIn the ordinary type of phonograph the record is made in\\nthe form of depressions or indentations on the surface of a\\ncylinder of wax; these indentations being produced by a\\nstylus actuated by vibrations set up in a diaphragm by the\\nact of speaking. In the telegraphone the same result is\\nobtained entirely by electro-magnetic action. The wax\\ncylinder of the phonograph is replaced by a steel wire or\\nribbon, and the recording stylus by an electro-magnet.172\\nThe steel ribbon is arranged to travel along over two\\ncylinders or reels kept in constant rotation, and a small\\nelectro-magnet is fixed midway between the cylinders so\\nthat the ribbon passes close above it. This magnet is\\nconnected to the telephone line, so that its magnetism\\nfluctuates in accordance with the variations in the current\\nin the line. We have seen that steel retains magnetism\\nimparted to it. In passing over the electro-magnet the\\nsteel ribbon is magnetized in constantly varying degrees,\\ncorresponding exactly with the variations in the line current\\nset up by the speaker’s voice, and these magnetic impressions\\nare retained by the ribbon. When the speaker has\\nfinished, the telephone line is disconnected, the ribbon is\\ncarried back to the point at which it started, and the\\napparatus is connected to the telephone receiver. The\\nribbon now moves forward again, and this time it acts like\\nthe speaker’s voice, the varying intensity of its magnetic\\nrecord producing corresponding variations in the strength\\nof the magnet, so causing the receiver diaphragm to reproduce\\nthe sounds in the ordinary way.',\n",
       " 'The magnetic record made in this manner is fairly\\npermanent, and if desired it may be reproduced over and\\nover again. In most cases, however, a permanent record\\nis of no value, and so the magnetic impressions are\\nobliterated in order that the ribbon may be used to take\\na new record. This can be done by passing a permanent\\nmagnet along the ribbon, but it is more convenient to have\\nan automatic obliterating arrangement. This consists of\\nanother electro-magnet fixed close to the recording magnet,\\nso that the ribbon passes over it before reaching the latter.\\nThe obliterating magnet is connected with a battery, and\\nits unvarying magnetism destroys all traces of the previous\\nrecord, and the ribbon passes forward to the recording\\nmagnet ready to receive new impressions.',\n",

By\\nspeaking into his instrument before going out, the owner\\ncan leave a message stating the time at which he expects\\nto return, and this message will be repeated by the telegraphone\\nto anybody ringing up in the meantime.

       " 'Another electrical apparatus for recording speech may\\nbe mentioned. This rejoices in the uncouth name of the\\nPhotographophone, and it is the invention of Ernst\\nRuhmer, a German. Its working is based upon the fact\\nthat the intensity of the light of the electric arc may be\\nvaried by sound vibrations, each variation in the latter\\nproducing a corresponding variation in the amount of light.\\nIn the photographophone the light of an arc lamp is passed\\nthrough a lens which focuses it upon a moving photographic\\nfilm. By speaking or singing, the light is made to vary in\\nbrilliance, and proportionate effects are produced in the\\nsilver bromide of the film. On developing the film a\\npermanent record of the changes in the light intensity is\\nobtained, in the form of shadings of different degrees of\\ndarkness. The film is now moved forward from end to\\nend in front of a fairly powerful lamp. The light passes\\nthrough the film, and falls upon a sort of plate made of\\nselenium. This is a non-metallic substance which possesses\\nthe curious property of altering its resistance to an electric\\ncurrent according to the amount of light falling upon it;174\\nthe greater the amount of light, the more current will the\\nselenium allow to pass. The selenium plate is connected\\nwith a telephone receiver and with a battery. As the film\\ntravels along, its varying shadings allow an ever-changing\\namount of light to pass through and fall upon the selenium,\\nwhich varies its resistance accordingly. The resulting\\nvariations in the current make the receiver diaphragm give\\nout a series of sounds, which are exact reproductions of the\\noriginal sounds made by the voice. The reproduction of\\nspeech by the photographophone is quite good, but as a\\nrule it is not so perfect as with the telegraphone.',\n",
       " 'About ten years ago a German inventor, Professor A.\\nKorn, brought out the first really practical method of\\ntelegraphing drawings or photographs. This invention is\\nremarkable not only for what it accomplishes, but perhaps\\nstill more for the ingenuity with which the many peculiar\\ndifficulties of the process are overcome. Like the photographophone,\\nKorn’s photo-telegraphic apparatus utilizes\\nthe power of selenium to alter its resistance with the amount\\nof light reaching it.',\n",
       " 'Almost everybody is familiar with the terms “positive”\\nand “negative” as used in photography. The finished paper\\nprint is a positive, with light and shade in the correct\\npositions; while the glass plate from which the print is made\\nis a negative, with light and shade reversed. The lantern\\nslide also is a positive, and it is exactly like the paper print,\\nexcept that it has a base of glass instead of paper, so that\\nit is transparent. Similarly, a positive may be made on a\\npiece of celluloid, and this, besides being transparent, is\\nflexible. The first step in transmitting on the Korn system\\nis to make from the photograph to be telegraphed a positive\\nof this kind, both transparent and flexible. This is bent\\nround a glass drum or cylinder, and fixed so that it cannot\\npossibly move. The cylinder is given a twofold movement.175\\nIt is rotated by means of an electric motor, and at\\nthe same time it is made to travel slowly along in the\\ndirection of its length. In fact its movement is very\\nsimilar to that of a screw, which turns round and moves\\nforward at the same time. A powerful beam of light is\\nconcentrated upon the positive. This beam remains\\nstationary, but owing to the dual movement of the cylinder\\nit passes over every part of the positive, following a spiral\\npath. Exactly the same effect would be produced by\\nkeeping the cylinder still and moving the beam spirally\\nround it, but this arrangement would be more difficult to\\nmanipulate. The forward movement of the cylinder is\\nextremely small, so that the spiral is as fine as it is possible\\nto get it without having adjacent lines actually touching.\\nThe light passes through the positive into the cylinder, and\\nis reflected towards a selenium cell; and as the positive\\nhas an almost infinite number of gradations of tone, or\\ndegrees of light and shade, the amount of light reaching\\nthe cell varies constantly all the time. The selenium\\ntherefore alters its resistance, and allows a constantly\\nvarying current to pass through it, and so to the transmission\\nline.',\n",
       " 'At the receiving end is another cylinder having the\\nsame rotating and forward movement, and round this is\\nfixed a sensitive photographic film. This film is protected\\nby a screen having a small opening, and no light can reach\\nit except through this aperture. The incoming current is\\nmade to control a beam of light focused to fall upon the\\nscreen aperture, the amount of light varying according to\\nthe amount of current. In this way the beam of light, like\\nthe one at the transmitting end, traces a spiral from end to\\nend of the film, and on developing the film a reproduction\\nof the original photograph is obtained. The telegraphed\\nphotograph is thus made up of an enormous number176\\nof lines side by side, but these are so close to one\\nanother that they are scarcely noticed, and the effect is\\nsomething like that of a rather coarse-grained ordinary\\nphotograph.',\n",
       " 'It is obvious that the success of this method depends\\nupon the maintaining of absolute uniformity in the motion\\nof the two cylinders, and this is managed in a very ingenious\\nway. It will be remembered that one method of securing\\nuniformity in a number of sub-clocks under the control of\\na master-clock is that of adjusting the sub-clocks to go a\\nlittle faster than the master-clock. Then, when the sub-clocks\\nreach the hour, they are held back by electro-magnetic\\naction until the master-clock arrives at the hour,\\nwhen all proceed together.',\n",
       " 'A similar method is employed for the cylinders. They\\nare driven by electric motors, and the motor at the receiving\\nend is adjusted so as to run very slightly faster\\nthan the motor at the sending end. The result is that\\nthe receiving cylinder completes one revolution a minute\\nfraction of a second before the transmitting cylinder. It\\nis then automatically held back until the sending cylinder\\ncompletes its revolution, and then both commence the next\\nrevolution exactly together. The pause made by the\\nreceiving cylinder is of extremely short duration, but in\\norder that there shall be no break in the spiral traced by\\nlight upon the film, the pause takes place at the point\\nwhere the ends of the film come together. In actual\\npractice certain other details of adjustment are required\\nto ensure precision in working, but the main features of\\nthe process are as described.',\n",
       " 'Although the above photo-telegraphic process is very\\nsatisfactory in working, it has been superseded to some\\nextent by another process of a quite different nature. By\\ncopying the original photograph through a glass screen177\\ncovered with a multitude of very fine parallel lines, a half-tone\\nreproduction is made. This is formed of an immense\\nnumber of light and dark lines of varying breadth, and it\\nis printed in non-conducting ink on lead-foil, so that while\\nthe dark lines are bare foil, the light ones are covered with\\nthe ink. This half-tone is placed round a metal cylinder\\nhaving the same movement as the cylinders in the previous\\nprocesses, and a metal point, or “stylus” as it is called, is\\nmade to rest lightly upon the foil picture, so that it travels\\nall over it, from one end to the other. An electrical circuit\\nis arranged so that when the stylus touches a piece of the\\nbare foil a current is sent out along the line wire. This\\ncurrent is therefore intermittent, being interrupted each\\ntime the stylus passes over a part of the half-tone picture\\ncovered with the non-conducting ink, the succeeding\\nperiods of current and no current varying with the breadth\\nof the conducting and the non-conducting lines. This\\nintermittent current goes to a similar arrangement of\\nstylus and cylinder at the receiving end, this cylinder\\nhaving round it a sheet of paper coated with a chemical\\npreparation. The coating is white all over to begin with,\\nbut it turns black wherever the current passes through it.\\nThe final result is that the intermittent current builds up\\na reproduction in black-and-white of the original photograph.\\nIn this process also the cylinders have to be\\n“synchronized,” or adjusted to run at the same speed.\\nBoth this process and the foregoing one have been used\\nsuccessfully for the transmission of press photographs,\\nnotably by the Daily Mirror.',\n",
       " 'Professor Korn has carried out some interesting and\\nfairly successful experiments in wireless transmission of\\nphotographs, but as yet the wireless results are considerably\\ninferior to those obtained with a line conductor. For\\ntransmitting black-and-white pictures, line drawings, or178\\nautographs by wireless, a combination of the two methods\\njust mentioned is employed; the second method being\\nused for sending, and the first or selenium method for\\nreceiving.

       " 'Wireless telegraphy is probably the most remarkable and\\nat the same time the most interesting of all the varied\\napplications of electricity.

The average man does\\nnot realize that although we are able to make electricity\\ncome and go at our bidding, we have little certain knowledge\\nof its nature. He is so accustomed to hearing of\\nthe electric current, and of the work it is made to do, that\\nhe sees little to marvel at so long as there is a connecting\\nwire.

But take\\naway the connecting wire, and the case is different. In\\nwireless telegraphy electricity is produced as usual, but\\ninstantly it passes out into the unknown, and, as far as\\nour senses can tell, it is lost for ever. Yet at some\\ndistant point, hundreds or even thousands of miles away,\\nthe electrical influence reappears, emerging from the\\nunknown with its burden of words and sentences. There\\nis something uncanny about this, something suggesting\\ntelepathy and the occult, and herein lies the fascination of\\nwireless telegraphy.',\n",

       " 'The idea of communicating without any connecting\\nwires is an old one. About the year 1842, Morse, of telegraph\\nfame, succeeded in transmitting telegraphic signals\\nacross rivers and canals without a connecting wire. His\\nmethod was to stretch along each bank of the river a wire\\nequal in length to three times the breadth of the river.\\nOne of these wires was connected with the transmitter and\\nwith a battery, and the other with a receiver, both wires\\nterminating in copper plates sunk in the water. In this\\ncase the water took the place of a connecting wire, and\\nacted as the conducting medium. A few years later\\nanother investigator, a Scotchman named Lindsay, succeeded\\nin telegraphing across the river Tay, at a point\\nwhere it is over a mile and a half wide, by similar methods.\\nLindsay appears to have been the first to suggest the possibility\\nof telegraphing across the Atlantic, and although at\\nthat time, 1845, the idea must have seemed a wild one, he\\nhad the firmest faith in its ultimate accomplishment.',\n",
       " 'Amongst those who followed Lindsay’s experiments\\nwith keen interest was the late Sir William, then Mr.\\nPreece, but it was not until 1882, twenty years after\\nLindsay’s death, that he commenced experiments on his\\nown account. In March of that year the cable across the\\nSolent failed, and Preece took the opportunity of trying to\\nsignal across without a connecting wire. He used two\\noverhead wires, each terminating in large copper plates\\nsunk in the sea, one stretching from Southampton to\\nSouthsea Pier, and the other from Ryde Pier to Sconce\\nPoint. The experiment was successful, audible Morse\\nsignals being received on each side. In this experiment,\\nas in those of Morse and Lindsay, the water acted as the\\nconducting medium; but a year or two later, Preece\\nturned his attention to a different method of wireless communication,\\nby means of induction. This method was181\\nbased upon the fact that at the instant of starting and\\nstopping a current in one wire, another current is induced\\nin a second wire placed parallel to it, even when the two\\nwires are a considerable distance apart. Many successful\\nexperiments in this induction telegraphy were made, one\\nof the most striking being that between the Island of Mull\\nand the mainland, in 1895. The cable between the island\\nand the mainland had broken, and by means of induction\\nperfect telegraphic communication was maintained during\\nthe time that the cable was being repaired. Although this\\nsystem of wireless telegraphy is quite successful for short\\ndistances, it becomes impracticable when the distance is\\nincreased, because the length of each of the two parallel\\nwires must be roughly equal to the distance between them.\\nThese experiments of Preece are of great interest, but we\\nmust leave them because they have little connexion with\\npresent-day wireless telegraphy, in which utterly different\\nmethods are used.',\n",
       " 'All the commercial wireless systems of to-day depend\\nupon the production and transmission of electric waves.\\nAbout the year 1837 it was discovered that the discharge\\nof a Leyden jar did not consist of only one sudden rush of\\nelectricity, but of a series of electric oscillations, which\\nsurged backwards and forwards until electric equilibrium\\nwas restored. This discovery was verified by later\\nexperimenters, and it forms the foundation of our knowledge\\nof electric waves. At this point many readers probably\\nwill ask, “What are electric waves?” It is impossible to\\nanswer this question fully, for we still have a great deal to\\nlearn about these waves, and we only can state the conclusions\\nat which our greatest scientists have arrived after\\nmuch thought and many experiments. It is believed that\\nall space is filled with a medium to which the name\\n“ether” has been given, and that this ether extends182\\nthroughout the matter. We do not know what the ether\\nis, but the important fact is that it can receive and transmit\\nvibrations in the form of ether waves. There are different\\nkinds of ether waves, and they produce entirely different\\neffects. Some of them produce the effect which we call\\nlight, and these are called “light waves.” Others produce\\nthe effect known as heat, and they are called “heat waves”;\\nand still others produce electricity, and these we call\\n“electric waves.” These waves travel through the ether at\\nthe enormous speed of 186,000 miles per second, so that\\nthey would cross the Atlantic Ocean in about 1/80 second.\\nThe fact that light also travels at this speed suggested that\\nthere might be some connexion between the two sets of\\nwaves, and after much experiment it has been demonstrated\\nthat the waves of light and electricity are identical except\\nin their length.',\n",
       " 'Later on in this chapter we shall have occasion to refer\\nfrequently to wave-length, and we may take this opportunity\\nof explaining what is understood by this term. Wave-length\\nis the distance measured from the crest of one wave\\nto the crest of the next, across the intervening trough or\\nhollow. From this it will be seen that the greater the\\nwave-length, the farther apart are the waves; and also that\\nif we have two sets of waves of different wave-lengths but\\ntravelling at the same speed, then the number of waves\\narriving at any point in one second will be greater in the\\ncase of the shorter waves, because these are closer together.',\n",
       " 'A tuning-fork in vibration disturbs the surrounding air,\\nand sets up air waves which produce the effect called sound\\nwhen they strike against the drums of our ears. In a\\nsimilar way the discharge of a Leyden jar disturbs the\\nsurrounding ether, and sets up electric ether waves; but\\nthese waves produce no effect upon us in the shape of sight,\\nsound, or feeling. There is however a very simple piece183\\nof apparatus which acts as a sort of electric eye or ear, and\\ndetects the waves for us. This consists of a glass tube\\nloosely filled with metal filings, and having a cork at each\\nend. A wire is passed through each cork so as to project\\nwell into the tube, but so that the two ends do not touch\\none another, and the outer ends of these wires are connected\\nto a battery of one or two cells, and to some kind of\\nelectrically worked apparatus, such as an electric bell. So\\nlong as the filings lie quite loosely in the tube they offer\\na very high resistance, and no current passes. If now\\nelectric waves are set up by the discharge of a Leyden jar,\\nthese waves fall upon the tube and cause the resistance\\nof the filings to decrease greatly. The filings now form a\\nconducting path through which the current passes, and so\\nthe bell rings. If no further discharge takes place the\\nelectric waves cease, but the filings do not return to their\\noriginal highly resistant condition, but retain their conductivity,\\nand the current continues to pass, and the bell\\ngoes on ringing. To stop the bell it is only necessary\\nto tap the tube gently, when the filings immediately fall\\nback into their first state, so that the current cannot pass\\nthrough them.',\n",
       " 'Now let us see how the “coherer,” as the filings tube is\\ncalled, is used in actual wireless telegraphy. Fig. 33a\\nshows a simple arrangement for the purpose. A is an\\ninduction coil, and B the battery supplying the current.\\nThe coil is fitted with a spark gap, consisting of two\\nhighly polished brass balls CC, one of these balls being\\nconnected to a vertical wire supported by a pole, and the\\nother to earth. D is a Morse key for starting and stopping\\nthe current. When the key is pressed down, current flows\\nfrom the battery to the coil, and in passing through the\\ncoil it is raised to a very high voltage, as described in\\nChapter VIII. This high tension current is sent into the184\\naerial wire, which quickly becomes charged up to its\\nutmost limits. But more current continues to arrive, and\\nso the electricity in the aerial, unable to bear any longer\\nthe enormous pressure, takes the only path of escape and\\nbursts violently across the air gap separating the brass\\nballs. Surging oscillations are then produced in the aerial,\\nthe ether is violently disturbed, and electric waves are\\nset in motion. This is the transmitting part of the\\napparatus.',\n",
       " 'If a stone is dropped into a pond, little waves are set in185\\nmotion, and these spread outwards in ever-widening rings.\\nElectric waves also are propagated outwards in widening\\nrings, but instead of travelling in one plane only, like the\\nwater waves, they proceed in every plane; and when they\\narrive at the receiving aerial they set up in it oscillations\\nof the same nature as those which produced the waves.\\nLet us suppose electric waves to reach the aerial wire of\\nFig. 33b. The resistance of the coherer H is at once lowered\\nso that current from battery N flows and operates the relay\\nF, which closes the circuit of battery M. This battery\\nhas a twofold task. It operates the sounder E, and it\\nenergizes the electro-magnet of the de-coherer K, as shown\\nby the dotted lines. This de-coherer is simply an electric\\nbell without the gong, arranged so that the hammer strikes\\nthe coherer tube; and its purpose is to tap the tube\\nautomatically and much more rapidly than is possible by\\nhand. The sounder therefore gives a click, and the de-coherer\\ntaps the tube, restoring the resistance of the\\nfilings. The circuit of battery N is then broken, and the\\nrelay therefore interrupts the circuit of battery M. If\\nwaves continue to arrive, the circuits are again closed,\\nanother click is given, and again the hammer taps the\\ntube. As long as waves are falling upon the aerial, the\\nalternate makings and breakings of the circuits follow one\\nanother very rapidly and the sounder goes on working.\\nWhen the waves cease, the hammer of the de-coherer has\\nthe last word, and the circuits of both batteries remain\\nbroken. To confine the electric waves to their proper\\nsphere two coils of wire, LL, called choking coils, are\\ninserted as shown.',\n",
       " 'In this simple apparatus we have all the really essential\\nfeatures of a wireless installation for short distances. For\\nlong distance work various modifications are necessary,\\nbut the principle remains exactly the same. In land wireless186\\nstations the single vertical aerial wire becomes an\\nelaborate arrangement of wires carried on huge masts and\\ntowers. The distance over which signals can be transmitted\\nand received depends to a considerable extent upon\\nthe height of the aerial, and consequently land stations\\nhave the supporting masts or towers from one to several\\nhundred feet in height, according to the range over which\\nit is desired to work. As a rule the same aerial is used both\\nfor transmitting and receiving, but some stations have a\\nseparate aerial for each purpose. A good idea of the\\nappearance of commercial aerials for long distance working\\nmay be obtained from the frontispiece, which shows the\\nMarconi station at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, from which\\nwireless communication is held with the Marconi station at\\nClifden, in Galway, Ireland.',\n",
       " 'In the first wireless stations what is called a “plain\\naerial” transmitter was used, and this was almost the same\\nas the transmitting apparatus in Fig. 33a, except, of course,\\nthat it was on a larger scale. This arrangement had many\\nserious drawbacks, including that of a very limited range,\\nand it has been abandoned in favour of the “coupled”\\ntransmitter, a sketch of which is shown in Fig. 34. In this\\ntransmitter there are two separate circuits, having the same\\nrate of oscillation. A is an induction coil, supplied with\\ncurrent from the battery B, and C is a condenser. A\\ncondenser is simply an apparatus for storing up charges of\\nelectricity. It may take a variety of forms, but in every\\ncase it must consist of two conducting layers separated by\\na non-conducting layer, the latter being called the\\n“dielectric.” The Leyden jar is a condenser, with conducting\\nlayers of tinfoil and a dielectric of glass, but the\\ncondensers used for wireless purposes generally consist of\\na number of parallel sheets of metal separated by glass or\\nmica, or in some cases by air only. The induction coil187\\ncharges up the condenser with high tension electricity, until\\nthe pressure becomes so great that the electricity is\\ndischarged in the form of a spark between the brass balls\\nof the spark gap D. The accumulated electric energy in\\nthe condenser then surges violently backwards and forwards,\\nand by induction corresponding surgings are produced in\\nthe aerial circuit, these latter surgings setting up electric\\nwaves in the ether.',\n",
       " 'For the sake of simplicity we have represented the\\napparatus as using an induction coil, but in all stations of\\nany size the coil is replaced by a step-up transformer, and188\\nthe current is supplied either from an electric light power\\nstation at some town near by, or from a power house specially\\nbuilt for the purpose. Alternating current is generally used,\\nand if the current supplied is continuous, it is converted into\\nalternating current. This may be done by making the\\ncontinuous current drive an electric motor, which in turn\\ndrives a dynamo generating alternating current. In any\\ncase, the original current is too low in voltage to be used\\ndirectly, but in passing through the transformer it is raised\\nto the required high pressure. The transmitting key,\\nwhich is inserted between the dynamo and the transformer,\\nis specially constructed to prevent the operator from receiving\\naccidental shocks, and the spark gap is enclosed in a\\nsort of sound-proof box, to deaden the miniature thunders\\nof the discharge.',\n",
       " 'During the time that signals are being transmitted,\\nsparks follow one another across the spark gap in rapid\\nsuccession, a thousand sparks per second being by no\\nmeans an uncommon rate. The violence of these rapid\\ndischarges raises the brass balls of the gap to a great heat.\\nThis has the effect of making the sparking spasmodic and\\nuncertain, with the result that the signals at the receiving\\nstation are unsatisfactory. To get over this difficulty\\nMarconi introduced a rotary spark gap. This is a wheel\\nwith projecting knobs or studs, mounted on the shaft of the\\ndynamo supplying the current, so that it rotates rapidly.\\nTwo stationary knobs are fixed so that the wheel rotates\\nbetween them, and the sparks are produced between these\\nfixed knobs and those of the wheel, a double spark gap\\nthus being formed. Overheating is prevented by the\\ncurrents of air set up by the rapid movement of the wheel,\\nand the sparking is always regular.',\n",
       " 'In the receiving apparatus already described a filings\\ncoherer was used to detect the ether waves, and, by means\\nof a local battery, to translate them into audible signals with\\na sounder, or printed signals with a Morse inker. This\\ncoherer however is unsuitable for commercial working.\\nIt is not sufficiently sensitive, and it can be used only for\\ncomparatively short distances; while its action is so slow\\nthat the maximum speed of signalling is not more than\\nabout seventeen or eighteen words a minute. A number\\nof different detectors of much greater speed and sensitiveness\\nhave been devised. The most reliable of these,\\nthough not the most sensitive, is the Marconi magnetic detector,\\nPlate XIII.b. This consists of a moving band made\\nof several soft iron wires twisted together, and passing close\\nto the poles of two horse-shoe magnets. As the band\\npasses from the influence of one magnet to that of the other\\nits magnetism becomes reversed, but the change takes a\\ncertain amount of time to complete owing to the fact that\\nthe iron has some magnetic retaining power, so that it\\nresists slightly the efforts of one magnet to reverse the\\neffect of the other. The moving band passes through two\\nsmall coils of wire, one connected with the aerial, and the\\nother with a specially sensitive telephone receiver. When\\nthe electric waves from the transmitting station fall upon\\nthe aerial of the receiving station, small, rapidly oscillating\\ncurrents pass through the first coil, and these have the\\neffect of making the band reverse its magnetism instantly.\\nThe sudden moving of the lines of magnetic force induces\\na current in the second coil, and produces a click in the\\ntelephone. As long as the waves continue, the clicks\\nfollow one another rapidly, and they are broken up into the\\nlong and short signals of the Morse code according to the\\nmanipulation of the Morse key at the sending station.\\nExcept for winding up at intervals the clockwork mechanism\\nwhich drives the moving band, this detector requires no\\nattention, and it is always ready for work.',\n",
       " '190',\n",
       " 'Another form of detector makes use of the peculiar\\npower possessed by certain crystals to rectify the oscillatory\\ncurrents received from the aerial, converting them into\\nuni-directional currents. At every discharge of the condenser\\nat the sending station a number of complete waves,\\nforming what is called a “train” of waves, is set in motion.\\nFrom each train of waves the crystal detector produces one\\nuni-directional pulsation of current, and this causes a click\\nin the telephone receiver. If these single pulsations follow\\none another rapidly and regularly, a musical note is heard\\nin the receiver. Various combinations of crystals, and\\ncrystals and metal points, are used, but all work in the\\nsame way. Some combinations work without assistance,\\nbut others require to have a small current passed through\\nthem from a local battery. The crystals are held in small\\ncups of brass or copper, mounted so that they can be\\nadjusted by means of set-screws. Crystal detectors are\\nextremely sensitive, but they require very accurate adjustment,\\nand any vibration quickly throws them out of order.',\n",
       " 'The “electrolytic” detector rectifies the oscillating\\ncurrents in a different manner. One form consists of a thin\\nplatinum wire passing down into a vessel made of lead,\\nand containing a weak solution of sulphuric acid. The\\ntwo terminals of a battery are connected to the wire and\\nthe vessel respectively. As long as no oscillations are\\nreceived from the aerial the current is unable to flow\\nbetween the wire and the vessel, but when the oscillations\\nreach the detector the current at once passes, and operates\\nthe telephone receiver. The action of this detector is not\\nthoroughly understood, and the way in which the point of\\nthe platinum wire prevents the passing of the current until\\nthe oscillations arrive from the aerial is something of a\\nmystery.',\n",
       " 'The last detector that need be described is the Fleming191\\nvalve receiver. This consists of an electric incandescent\\nlamp, with either carbon or tungsten filament, into which\\nis sealed a plate of platinum connected with a terminal outside\\nthe lamp. The plate and the filament do not touch\\none another, but when the lamp is lighted up a current can\\nbe passed from the plate to the filament, but not from filament\\nto plate. This receiver acts in a similar way to the\\ncrystal detector, making the oscillating currents into uni-directional\\ncurrents. It has proved a great success for\\ntransatlantic wireless communication between the Marconi\\nstations at Clifden and Glace Bay, and is extensively used.',\n",
       " 'The electric waves set in motion by the transmitting\\napparatus of a wireless station spread outwards through\\nthe ether in all directions, and so instead of reaching only\\nthe aerial of the particular station with which it is desired\\nto communicate, they affect the aerials of all stations within\\na certain range. So long as only one station is sending\\nmessages this causes no trouble; but when, as is actually\\nthe case, large numbers of stations are hard at work transmitting\\ndifferent messages at the same time, it is evident\\nthat unless something can be done to prevent it, each of\\nthese messages will be received at the same moment by\\nevery station within range, thus producing a hopeless confusion\\nof signals from which not a single message can be\\nread. Fortunately this chaos can be avoided by what is\\ncalled “tuning.”',\n",
       " 'Wireless tuning consists in adjusting the aerial of the\\nreceiving station so that it has the same natural rate of\\noscillation as that of the transmitting station. A simple\\nexperiment will make clearer the meaning of this. If we\\nstrike a tuning-fork, so that it sounds its note, and while it\\nis sounding strongly place near it another fork of the same\\npitch and one of a different pitch, we find that the fork of\\nsimilar pitch also begins to sound faintly, whereas the third192\\nfork remains silent. The explanation is that the two forks\\nof similar pitch have the same natural rate of vibration,\\nwhile the other fork vibrates at a different rate. When\\nthe first fork is struck, it vibrates at a certain rate, and sets\\nin motion air waves of a certain length. These waves\\nreach both the other forks, but their effect is different in\\neach case. On reaching the fork of similar pitch the first\\nwave sets it vibrating, but not sufficiently to give out a\\nsound. But following this wave come others, and as the\\nfork has the same rate of vibration as the fork which\\nproduced the waves, each wave arrives just at the right\\nmoment to add its impulse to that of the preceding wave,\\nso that the effect accumulates and the fork sounds. In the\\ncase of the third fork of different pitch, the first wave sets\\nit also vibrating, but as this fork cannot vibrate at the same\\nrate as the one producing the waves, the latter arrive at\\nwrong intervals; and instead of adding together their\\nimpulses they interfere with one another, each upsetting\\nthe work of the one before it, and the fork does not sound.\\nThe same thing may be illustrated with a pendulum. If\\nwe give a pendulum a gentle push at intervals corresponding\\nto its natural rate of swing, the effects of all these\\npushes are added together, and the pendulum is made to\\nswing vigorously. If, on the other hand, we give the pushes\\nat longer or shorter intervals, they will not correspond with\\nthe pendulum’s rate of swing, so that while some pushes\\nwill help the pendulum, others will hinder it, and the final\\nresult will be that the pendulum is brought almost to a\\nstandstill, instead of being made to swing strongly and\\nregularly. The same principle holds good with wireless\\naerials. Any aerial will respond readily to all other aerials\\nhaving the same rate of oscillation, because the waves in\\neach case are of the same length; that is to say, they follow\\none another at the same intervals. On the other hand, an193\\naerial will not respond readily to waves from another aerial\\nhaving a different rate of oscillation, because these do not\\nfollow each other at intervals to suit it.',\n",
       " 'If each station could receive signals only from stations\\nhaving aerials similar to its own, its usefulness would be\\nvery limited, and so all stations are provided with means\\nof altering the rate of oscillation of their aerials. The\\nactual tuning apparatus by which this is accomplished need\\nnot be described, as it is complicated, but what happens in\\npractice is this: The operator, wearing telephone receivers\\nfixed over his ears by means of a head band, sits at a\\ndesk upon which are placed his various instruments. He\\nadjusts the tuning apparatus to a position in which\\nsignals from stations of widely different wave-lengths are\\nreceived fairly well, and keeps a general look out over\\npassing signals. Presently he hears his own call-signal,\\nand knows that some station wishes to communicate with\\nhim. Immediately he alters the adjustment of his tuner\\nuntil his aerial responds freely to the waves from this\\nstation, but not to waves from other stations, and in this\\nway he is able to cut out signals from other stations and to\\nlisten to the message without interruption.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately wireless tuning is yet far from perfect in\\ncertain respects. For instance, if two stations are transmitting\\nat the same time on the same wave-length, it is\\nclearly impossible for a receiving operator to cut one out\\nby wave-tuning, and to listen to the other only. In such\\na case, however, it generally happens that although the\\nwave-frequency is the same, the frequency of the wave\\ngroups or trains is different, so that there is a difference\\nin the notes heard in the telephones; and a skilful operator\\ncan distinguish between the two sufficiently well to read\\nwhichever message is intended for him. The stations\\nwhich produce a clear, medium-pitched note are the easiest194\\nto receive from, and in many cases it is possible to identify\\na station at once by its characteristic note. Tuning is also\\nunable to prevent signals from a powerful station close at\\nhand from swamping to some extent signals from another\\nstation at a great distance, the nearer station making the\\nreceiving aerial respond to it as it were by brute force,\\ntuning or no tuning.',\n",
       " 'Another source of trouble lies in interference by atmospheric\\nelectricity. Thunderstorms, especially in the\\ntropics, interfere greatly with the reception of signals,\\nthe lightning discharges giving rise to violent, irregular\\ngroups of waves which produce loud noises in the telephones.\\nThere are also silent electrical disturbances in the\\natmosphere, and these too produce less strong but equally\\nweird effects. Atmospheric discharges are very irregular,\\nwithout any real wave-length, so that an operator cannot\\ncut them out by wave-tuning pure and simple in the way\\njust described, as they defy him by affecting equally all\\nadjustments. Fortunately, the irregularity of the atmospherics\\nproduces correspondingly irregular sounds in the\\ntelephones, quite unlike the clear steady note of a wireless\\nstation; and unless the atmospherics are unusually strong\\nthis note pierces through them, so that the signals can be\\nread. The effects of lightning discharges are too violent\\nto be got rid of satisfactorily, and practically all that can\\nbe done is to reduce the loudness of the noises in the\\ntelephones, so that the operator is not temporarily deafened.\\nDuring violent storms in the near neighbourhood of a\\nstation it is usual to connect the aerial directly to earth,\\nso that in the event of its being struck by a flash the\\nelectricity passes harmlessly away, instead of injuring the\\ninstruments, and possibly also the operators. Marconi\\nstations are always fitted with lightning-arresters.',\n",
       " 'The methods and apparatus we have described so far195\\nare those of the Marconi system, and although in practice\\nadditional complicated and delicate pieces of apparatus are\\nused, the description given represents the main features of\\nthe system. Although Marconi was not the discoverer of\\nthe principles of wireless telegraphy, he was the first to\\nproduce a practical working system. In 1896 Marconi came\\nfrom Italy to England, bringing with him his apparatus,\\nand after a number of successful demonstrations of its\\nworking, he succeeded in convincing even the most sceptical\\nexperts that his system was thoroughly sound. Commencing\\nwith a distance of about 100 yards, Marconi\\nrapidly increased the range of his experiments, and by\\nthe end of 1897 he succeeded in transmitting signals\\nfrom Alum Bay, in the Isle of Wight, to a steamer 18\\nmiles away. In 1899 messages were exchanged between\\nBritish warships 85 miles apart, and the crowning achievement\\nwas reached in 1901, when Marconi received readable\\nsignals at St. John’s, Newfoundland, from Poldhu in Cornwall,\\na distance of about 1800 miles. In 1907 the Marconi\\nstations at Clifden and Glace Bay were opened for public\\nservice, and by the following year transatlantic wireless\\ncommunication was in full swing. The sending of wireless\\nsignals across the Atlantic was a remarkable accomplishment,\\nbut it did not represent by any means the limits\\nof the system, as was shown in 1910. In that year\\nMarconi sailed for Buenos Ayres, and wireless communication\\nwith Clifden was maintained up to the almost incredible\\ndistance of 4000 miles by day, and 6735 miles by night.\\nThe Marconi system has had many formidable rivals, but\\nit still holds the proud position of the most successful commercial\\nwireless system in the world.',\n",
       " 'We have not space to give a description of the other\\ncommercial systems, but a few words on some of the chief\\npoints in which they differ from the Marconi system may196\\nbe of interest. We have seen that an ordinary spark gap,\\nformed by two metal balls a short distance apart, becomes\\noverheated by the rapid succession of discharges, with the\\nresult that the sparking is irregular. What actually\\nhappens is that the violent discharge tears off and vaporizes\\nminute particles of the metal. This intensely heated\\nvapour forms a conducting path which the current is able\\nto cross, so that an arc is produced just in the same way\\nas in the arc lamp. This arc is liable to be formed by\\neach discharge, and it lasts long enough to prevent the\\nsparks from following one another promptly. In the\\nMarconi system this trouble is avoided by means of a\\nrotating spark gap, but in the German “Telefunken”\\nsystem, so named from Greek tele, far off, and German\\nFunke, a spark, a fixed compound spark gap is used\\nfor the same purpose. This consists of a row of metal\\ndiscs about 1/100 inch apart, and the spark leaps these\\ntiny gaps one after the other. The discs are about\\n3 inches in diameter, and their effect is to conduct away\\nquickly the heat of the discharge. By this means the\\nformation of an arc is prevented, and the effect of each\\ndischarge is over immediately, the sparks being said to be\\n“quenched.” The short discharges enable more energy to\\nbe radiated from the aerial into the ether, and very high\\nrates of sparking are obtained, producing a high-pitched\\nmusical note.',\n",
       " 'The “Lepel” system also uses a quenched spark.\\nThe gap consists of two metal discs clamped together and\\nseparated only by a sheet of paper. The paper has a hole\\nthrough its centre, and through this hole the discharge\\ntakes place, the discs being kept cool by water in constant\\ncirculation. The discharge is much less noisy than in the\\nMarconi and Telefunken systems, and the musical note\\nproduced is so sensitive that by varying the adjustments197\\nsimple tunes can be played, and these can be heard quite\\ndistinctly in the telephone at the receiving stations.',\n",
       " 'In the three systems already mentioned spark\\ndischarges are used to set up oscillatory currents in the\\naerial, which in turn set up waves in the ether. Each\\ndischarge sets in motion a certain number of waves,\\nforming what is known as a train of waves. The discharges\\nfollow one another very rapidly, but still there is a\\nminute interval between them, and consequently there is a\\ncorresponding interval between the wave-trains. In the\\n“Goldschmidt” system the waves are not sent out in\\ngroups of this kind, but in one long continuous stream.\\nThe oscillatory currents which produce ether waves are\\nreally alternating currents which flow backwards and\\nforwards at an enormous speed. The alternating current\\nproduced at an ordinary power station is of no use for\\nwireless purposes, because its “frequency,” or rate of flow\\nbackwards and forwards, is far too low. It has been\\nfound possible however to construct special dynamos\\ncapable of producing alternating current of the necessary\\nhigh frequency, and such dynamos are used in the\\nGoldschmidt system. The dynamos are connected directly\\nto the aerial, so that the oscillatory currents in the latter\\nare continuous, and the ether waves produced are continuous\\nalso.',\n",
       " 'The “Poulsen” system produces continuous waves in\\nan altogether different manner, by means of the electric\\narc. The arc is formed between a fixed copper electrode\\nand a carbon electrode kept in constant rotation, and it is\\nenclosed in a kind of box filled with methylated spirit\\nvapour, hydrogen, or coal gas. A powerful electro-magnet\\nis placed close to the arc, so that the latter is surrounded\\nby a strong magnetic field. Connected with the terminals\\nof the arc is a circuit consisting of a condenser and a coil198\\nof wire, and the arc sets up in this circuit oscillatory\\ncurrents which are communicated to the aerial. These\\ncurrents are continuous, and so also are the resulting\\nwaves.',\n",
       " 'The method of signalling employed in these two\\ncontinuous-wave systems is quite different from that used\\nin the Marconi and other spark systems. It is practically\\nimpossible to signal by starting and stopping the alternating-current\\ndynamos or the arc at long or short intervals to\\nrepresent dashes or dots. In one case the sudden changes\\nfrom full load to zero would cause the dynamo to vary its\\nspeed, and consequently the wave-length would be\\nirregular; besides which the dynamo would be injured by\\nthe sudden strains. In the other case it would be\\nextremely difficult to persuade the arc to start promptly\\neach time. On this account the dynamo and the arc are\\nkept going continuously while a message is being transmitted,\\nand the signals are given by altering the wave-length.\\nIn other words, the transmitting aerial is thrown\\nin and out of tune alternately at the required long or short\\nintervals, and the receiving aerial responds only during the\\n“in-tune” intervals.',\n",
       " 'The various receiving detectors previously described\\nare arranged to work with dis-continuous waves, producing\\na separate current impulse from each group or train of\\nwaves. In continuous wave systems there are of course\\nno separate groups, and for this reason these detectors are\\nof no use, and a different arrangement is required. The\\noscillatory currents set up in the aerial are allowed to\\ncharge up a condenser, and this condenser is automatically\\ndisconnected from the aerial and connected to the operator’s\\ntelephones at regular intervals of about 1/1000 second.\\nEach time the condenser is connected to the telephones\\nit is discharged, and a click is produced. These clicks199\\ncontinue only as long as the waves are striking the aerial,\\nand as the transmitting operator interrupts the waves at\\nlong or short intervals the clicks are split up into groups of\\ncorresponding length.',\n",
       " 'Continuous waves have certain advantages over dis-continuous\\nwaves, particularly in the matter of sharp\\ntuning, but these advantages are outweighed to a large\\nextent by weak points in the transmitting apparatus. The\\ndynamos used to produce the high-frequency currents in\\nthe Goldschmidt system are very expensive to construct\\nand troublesome to keep in order; while in the Poulsen\\nsystem the arc is difficult to keep going for long periods,\\nand it is liable to fluctuations which greatly affect its\\nworking power. Although all the commercial Marconi\\ninstallations make use of dis-continuous waves exclusively,\\nMr. Marconi is still carrying out experiments with continuous\\nwaves.',\n",
       " 'There are many points in wireless telegraphy yet to be\\nexplained satisfactorily. Our knowledge of the electric\\nether waves is still limited, and we do not know for certain\\nhow these waves travel from place to place, or exactly\\nwhat happens to them on their journeys. For this reason\\nwe are unable to give a satisfactory explanation of the\\ncurious fact that, generally speaking, it is easier to signal\\nover long distances at night than during the day. Still\\nmore peculiar is the fact that it is easier to signal in a\\nnorth and south direction than in an east and west\\ndirection. There are also remarkable variations in the\\nstrength of the signals at certain times, particularly about\\nsunset and sunrise. Every station has a certain normal\\nrange which does not vary much as a rule, but at odd\\ntimes astonishing “freak” distances are covered, stations\\nhaving for a short time ranges far beyond their usual limits.\\nThese and other problems are being attacked by many200\\ninvestigators, and no doubt before very long they will be\\nsolved.

In\\nChapter IV. we saw how a current of high voltage could\\nbe obtained by connecting a number of cells in series, and\\nat these stations the necessary high voltage is produced by\\nconnecting a number of powerful dynamos in series, on the205\\nsame principle.

In the days when wireless\\nwas unknown, a navigator was thrown entirely upon his\\nown resources as soon as his vessel was out of sight of\\nland, for no information of any kind could reach him.\\nEven with a wireless installation on board, the captain of a\\nvessel still needs the same skill and watchfulness as of old,\\nbut in the times of uncertainty and danger to which all\\nships are liable, he often is able to obtain information which\\nmay prevent disaster.

To avoid the possibility of\\nmistakes from this cause, wireless time signals are sent out\\nat regular intervals by certain high-power stations, and as\\nlong as a vessel is within range of one of these stations the\\nslightest variation in the chronometers may be detected\\nimmediately. Amongst these stations are the Eiffel Tower,\\ngiving time signals at 10 a.m. and at midnight; and Norddeich,\\nGermany, giving signals at noon and midnight.\\nThese time signals have proved most useful also on land,\\nmore particularly for astronomers and for explorers engaged\\non surveying work.',\n",

At the first tidings of disaster he\\npresses a key, and out across the waters speed electric\\nwaves bearing the wireless cry for help, “S.O.S.,” incessantly\\nrepeated. Far away, on another liner, is a\\nsimilar small cabin, and its occupant is busy with messages\\nof everyday matters. Suddenly, in the midst of his work,\\ncomes the call from the stricken vessel, and instantly all\\nelse is forgotten. No matter what the message in hand, it\\nmust wait, for lives are in danger. Quickly the call is\\nanswered, the position of the doomed ship received, and\\nthe captain is informed. A few orders are hurriedly given,\\nthe ship’s course is changed, and away she steams to the\\nrescue, urged on by the full power of her engines. In an\\nhour or two she arrives alongside, boats are lowered, and\\npassengers and crew are snatched from death and placed\\nin safety. This scene, with variations, has been enacted\\nmany times, and never yet has wireless failed to play its\\npart. It is only too true that in some instances many\\nlives have been lost, but in these cases it is necessary to\\nremember that without wireless every soul on board might\\nhave gone down.

In many cases,\\nhowever, the accident is caused by some oversight on the\\npart of the signalman or the engine-driver. Probably the\\ngreat majority of such accidents are not due to real carelessness\\nor inattention to duty, but to unaccountable freaks\\nof the brain, through which some little detail, never before\\nforgotten, is overlooked completely until too late. We all211\\nare liable to these curious mental lapses, but happily in most\\ncases these do not lead to disaster of any kind. The ever-present\\npossibility of accidents brought about in this way is\\nrecognized fully by railway authorities, and every effort is\\nmade to devise mechanism which will safeguard a train in\\ncase of failure of the human element. The great weakness\\nof the ordinary railway system is that there is no reliable\\nmeans of communicating with the driver of a train except\\nby the fixed signals, so that when a train has passed one\\nset of signals it is generally beyond the reach of a message\\nuntil it arrives at the next set. On the enterprising\\nLackawanna Railroad, in the United States, an attempt has\\nbeen made to remove this defect by means of wireless\\ntelegraphy, and the experiment has been remarkably\\nsuccessful.

The aerial, which must be\\nlow on account of bridges and tunnels, consists of rectangles\\nof wire fixed at a height of 18 inches above the roof of\\neach car. These separate aerials are connected together\\nby a wire running to a small operating room containing a\\nset of Marconi apparatus, and situated at the end of one of\\nthe cars. The earth connexion is made to the track rails,\\nand the current is taken from the dynamos used to supply\\nthe train with electric light. With this equipment messages\\nhave been transmitted and received while the train was\\nrunning at the rate of 70 miles an hour, and distances\\nup to 125 miles have been covered. During a severe\\nstorm in the early part of last year the telegraph and\\ntelephone lines along the railroad broke down, but\\nuninterrupted communication was maintained by wireless,212\\nand the operations of the relief gangs and the snow-ploughs\\nwere directed by this means. For emergency signalling\\nthis system is likely to prove of enormous importance. If\\nsignals are set wrongly, through some misunderstanding,\\nand a train which should have been held up is passed\\nforward into danger, it can be stopped by a wireless message\\nin time to prevent an accident. Again, if a train has a\\nbreakdown, or if it sticks fast in a snow-drift, its plight and\\nits exact position can be signalled to the nearest station, so\\nthat help may be sent without delay. The possibilities of\\nthe system in fact are almost unlimited, and it seems not\\nunlikely that wireless telegraphy will revolutionize the\\nlong-distance railway travelling of the future.',\n",
       " 'In our chapter on the accumulator or storage cell we saw\\nthat a current of electricity has the power of decomposing\\ncertain liquids; that is to say, it is able to split them up\\ninto their component parts. This power has given rise\\nto the important art of electroplating and electrotyping.\\nElectroplating is the process of depositing a coating of a\\nrarer metal, such as gold, silver, or nickel, upon the\\nsurface of baser or commoner metals; and electrotyping is\\nthe copying of casts, medals, types, and other similar\\nobjects. The fact that metals could be deposited by the\\ndecomposition of a solution by a current was known in the\\nearly days of the voltaic cell, but no one seems to have\\npaid much attention to it. An Italian chemist published\\nin 1805 an account of his success in coating two silver\\nmedals with gold, and some thirty years later Bessemer\\ntransformed lead castings into fairly presentable ornaments\\nby coating them with copper, but commercial electroplating\\nmay be said to have begun about 1840, when an\\nEnglishman named Elkington took out a patent for the\\nprocess. Since then the processes of electroplating and\\nelectrotyping have rapidly come more and more into use,\\nuntil to-day they are practised on a vast scale, giving employment\\nto thousands.',\n",
       " 'Electroplating on a small scale is a very simple affair.\\nA solution of the metal which it is desired to deposit is214\\nplaced in a suitable vessel. Two metal rods are placed\\nacross the top of this vessel, and from one of these is\\nsuspended a plate of the same metal as that in the solution,\\nand from the other is hung the article to receive the\\ncoating. The positive terminal of a voltaic battery is\\nconnected to the rod supporting the plate, and the negative\\nterminal to the rod carrying the article to be plated. As\\nthe current passes through the solution from the plate to the\\narticle the solution is decomposed, and the article receives\\na coating of metal. The solution through which the\\ncurrent passes, and which is decomposed, is called the\\nelectrolyte, and the terminal points at which the current\\nenters and leaves the solution are called electrodes. The\\nelectrode by which the current enters the electrolyte is\\ncalled the anode, and the one by which it leaves is called\\nthe cathode.',\n",
       " 'If we wish to deposit a coating of copper on, say, an\\nold spoon which has been dismissed from household service,\\na solution of sulphate of copper must be made up and\\nplaced in a glass or stoneware jar. Two little rods of\\nbrass, copper, or any other good conductor are placed\\nacross the jar, one at each side, and by means of hooks of\\nwire a plate of copper is hung from one rod and the spoon\\nfrom the other. The positive terminal of a battery of\\nDaniell cells is then connected to the anode rod which\\nsupports the copper plate, and the negative terminal to\\nthe cathode rod carrying the spoon. The current now\\ncommences its task of splitting up the copper-sulphate\\nsolution into pure copper and sulphuric acid, and depositing\\nthis copper upon the spoon. The latter is very quickly\\ncovered with a sort of “blush” copper, and the coating\\ngrows thicker and thicker as long as the current is kept\\nat work. If there were no copper plate forming the anode\\nthe process would soon come to a standstill, on account of215\\nthe copper in the electrolyte becoming used up; but as it\\nis the sulphuric acid separated out of the electrolyte takes\\ncopper from the plate and combines with it to form a\\nfurther supply of copper sulphate. In this way the strength\\nof the solution is kept up, and the copper anode becomes\\nsmaller and smaller as the coating on the spoon increases\\nin thickness. It is not necessary that the anode should\\nconsist of absolutely pure copper, because any impurities\\nwill be precipitated to the bottom or mixed with the\\nsolution, nothing but quite pure copper being deposited on\\nthe spoon. At the same time if the copper anode is very\\nimpure the electrolyte quickly becomes foul, and has to be\\npurified or replaced by new solution.',\n",
       " 'To nickel-plate the spoon we should require a nickel\\nplate for the anode and a nickel solution; to silver-plate it,\\na silver anode and solution, and so on. Fig. 35 shows at\\nsimple but effective arrangement for amateur electroplating\\nin a small way.',\n",
       " 'Electroplating on a commercial scale is of course a\\nmuch more elaborate process, but the principle remains\\nexactly the same. Fig. 36 shows the general arrangement\\nof a plating shop. It is obviously extremely important216\\nthat the deposit on a plated article should be durable, and\\nto ensure that the coating will adhere firmly the article\\nmust be cleaned thoroughly before being plated. Cleanliness\\nin the ordinary domestic sense is not sufficient, for\\nthe article must be chemically clean. Some idea of the\\ncare required in this respect may be gained from the fact\\nthat if the cleaned surface is touched with the hand before\\nbeing plated, the coating will strip off the parts that have\\nbeen touched. The surfaces are first cleaned mechanically,\\nand then chemically by immersion in solutions of acids or\\nalkalies, the cleaning process varying to some extent with\\ndifferent metals. There is also a very interesting process\\nof cleaning by electricity. The article is placed in a vat\\nfitted with anode and cathode rods, just as in an ordinary\\nplating vat, and containing a solution of hydrate of potash\\nand cyanide of potassium. The anode consists of a carbon\\nplate, and the article is hung from the cathode rod.\\nSufficient current is passed through the solution to cause\\ngas to be given off rapidly at the cathode, and as this gas\\nrises to the surface it carries with it the grease and dirt\\nfrom the article, in the form of a dirty scum. After a\\nshort time the article becomes oxidized and discoloured,\\nand the current is then reversed, so that the article becomes\\nthe anode, and the carbon plate the cathode. The\\ncurrent now removes the oxide from the surface of the\\narticle, which is left quite bright and chemically clean.',\n",
       " 'When thoroughly cleaned the articles are ready to be\\nplaced in the plating vats. These vats are usually made\\nof wood lined with chemically pure lead, or of iron lined\\nwith enamel or cement. Anode and cathode rods made\\nof brass are placed across the vats, and from these the\\nanodes of the various metals and the articles to be plated\\nare hung by hooks of nickel or brass. Any number of\\nrods may be used, according to the size of the vat, so long218\\nas the articles have an anode on each side. If three rods\\nare used the articles are hung from the centre one, and the\\nanodes from the outside ones. If a number of small\\narticles are to be plated together they are often suspended\\nin perforated metal trays. Small articles are also plated\\nby placing them in a perforated barrel of wood, or wood\\nand celluloid, which revolves in the solution. While the\\narticles are being plated the revolving of the barrel makes\\nthem rub one against the other, so that they are brightly\\nburnished. Dog chains, cycle chain links, button-hooks,\\nand harness fittings are amongst the articles plated by\\nmeans of the revolving barrel.',\n",
       " 'The strength of current required for different kinds of\\nplating varies considerably, and if the work is to be of the\\nbest quality it is very important that the current should be\\nexactly right for the particular process in hand. In order\\nto adjust it accurately variable resistances of German silver\\nwire are provided for each vat, the current having to pass\\nthrough the resistance before reaching the solution. The\\nvolume and the pressure of the current are measured by\\namperemeters and voltmeters attached to the resistance\\nboards. If the intensity of the current is too great the\\narticles are liable to be “burnt,” when the deposit is dark\\ncoloured and often useless.',\n",
       " 'When exceptionally irregular surfaces have to be plated\\nit is sometimes necessary to employ an anode of special\\nshape, in order to keep as uniform a distance as possible\\nbetween the electrodes. If this is not done, those parts of\\nthe surface nearest the anode get more than their share of\\nthe current, and so they receive a thicker deposit than the\\nparts farther away.',\n",
       " 'An interesting process is that known as “parcel-plating,”\\nby which decorative coatings of different coloured metals\\ncan be deposited on one article. For instance, if it is219\\ndesired to have gold flowers on a silver brooch, the parts\\nwhich are not to be gilded are painted over with a non-conducting\\nvarnish. When this varnish is quite dry the\\nbrooch is placed in the gilding vat and the current sent\\nthrough in the usual way. The gold is then deposited only\\non the parts unprotected by varnish, and after the gilding\\nthe varnish is easily removed by softening it in turpentine\\nand brushing with a bristle brush. More elaborate\\ncombinations of different coloured metals can be made in\\nthe same way.',\n",

A piece of gold wrapped in calico is attached\\nto the anode rod, suspended in the solution inside the\\narticle, and moved about quickly until the deposit is of the\\nrequired thickness.',\n",
       " 'The time occupied in plating is greatly shortened by\\nstirring or agitating the solutions. This sets up a good\\ncirculation of the liquid, and a continual supply of fresh\\nsolution is brought to the cathode. At the same time the\\nresistance to the current is decreased, and more current\\nmay be used without fear of burning. Fig. 37 shows an\\narrangement for this purpose. The solution is agitated by\\ncompressed air, and at the same time the cathode rods are\\nmoved backwards and forwards. Plating solutions are\\nalso frequently heated in order to hasten the rate of\\ndeposition.',\n",

       " 'It sometimes happens that an article which has been\\nplated and polished shows little defects here and there in\\nthe deposit. In such a case it is not necessary to re-plate\\nthe whole article, for the defects can be made good by a221\\nprocess of “doctoring.” A piece of the same metal as that\\nforming the deposit is placed between two pieces of wood,\\nand a wire fastened to one end of it. At the other end\\nseveral thicknesses of flannel are wrapped round and\\nsecurely tied.

Practically\\nall materials can be electroplated, but if they are non-conductors\\nthey must be given a conducting surface in the\\nway just described or by some similar means.

The process is largely used for\\ncopying engraved plates for printing purposes. The plate222\\nis first rubbed over with a very weak solution of beeswax\\nin turpentine, to prevent the deposit from adhering to it,\\nand it is then placed in a copperplating vat and given a\\ngood thick coating. The coating is then stripped off, and\\nin this way a reversed copy of the plate is obtained. This\\ncopy is then replaced in the vat, and a coating of copper\\ndeposited upon it, and this coating, when stripped off, forms\\nan exact reproduction of the original, with every detail\\nfaithfully preserved. An engraved plate may be copied\\nalso by making from it a mould of plaster or composition.\\nThe surface of this mould is then rendered conducting by\\nsprinkling over it a quantity of plumbago, which is well\\nbrushed into all the recesses, and a coating of copper\\ndeposited on it. As the mould was a reversed copy of the\\noriginal, the coating formed upon it is of course an exact\\ncopy of the plate. If the copy has to be made very quickly\\na preliminary deposit of copper is chemically formed on the\\nmould before it is placed in the vat. This is done by\\npouring on to the mould a solution of sulphate of copper,\\nand sprinkling iron filings over the surface. The filings\\nare then brushed down on to the face of the mould with a\\nfine brush, and a chemical reaction takes place, resulting in\\nthe precipitation of copper from the solution.

For most purposes\\nthese impurities greatly affect the value of the copper, and\\nbefore the metal can be of much commercial use they must\\nbe got rid of in some way. In the previous chapter, in\\ndescribing how to copperplate an old spoon, we saw that\\nthe anode need not consist of pure copper, because in any\\ncase nothing but the pure metal would be deposited upon\\nthe spoon.

A solution of copper sulphate is used as\\nusual for the electrolyte, and the anode is a thick cast plate\\nof the impure copper. The result of passing a current\\nthrough the solution is that copper is taken from the anode\\nand carried to the cathode, the impurities falling to the\\nbottom of the vat and accumulating as a sort of slime. In\\nthis way thick slabs of pure copper are obtained, ready to\\nbe melted down and cast into ingots.',\n",

       " 'The metal aluminium has come into general use with\\nsurprising rapidity, and during the last twenty-five or\\nthirty years the amount of this metal produced annually\\nhas increased from two or three tons to many thousands\\nof tons. Aluminium occurs naturally in large quantities,\\nin the form of alumina, or oxide of aluminium, but for a\\nlong time experimenters despaired of ever obtaining the\\npure metal cheaply on a commercial scale. The oxides of\\nmost metals can be reduced, that is deprived of their oxygen,\\nby heating them with carbon; but aluminium oxide holds\\non to its oxygen with extraordinary tenacity, and absolutely\\nrefuses to be parted from it in this way. One process\\nafter another was tried, without success, and cheap\\naluminium seemed to be an impossibility until about 1887,\\nwhen two chemists, Hall, an American, and Héroult, a226\\nFrenchman, discovered a satisfactory solution of the\\nproblem. These chemists, who were then scarcely out of\\ntheir student days, worked quite independently of one\\nanother, and it is a remarkable fact that their methods,\\nwhich are practically alike, were discovered at almost the\\nsame time. The process is an interesting mixture of\\nelectrolysis and electric heating. An iron crucible containing\\na mixture of alumina, fluorspar, and cryolite is\\nheated. The two last-named substances are quickly fused,\\nand the alumina dissolves in the resulting fluid. When\\nthe mixture has reached the fluid state, electrodes made of\\ncarbon are dipped into it, and a current is passed through;\\nwith the result that oxygen is given off at the anode, and\\nmetallic aluminium is produced at the cathode, in molten\\ndrops. This molten metal is heavier than the rest of the\\nfluid, and so it falls to the bottom. From here it is drawn\\noff at intervals, while fresh alumina is added as required,\\nso that the process goes on without interruption. After\\nthe first fusing of the mixture no further outside heat is\\nrequired, for the heat produced by the passage of the\\ncurrent is sufficient to keep the materials in a fluid state.\\nVast quantities of aluminium are produced in this way at\\nNiagara Falls, and in Scotland and Switzerland.',\n",

A solution of this in water\\nis placed in a vat or cell, and a current is sent through it.\\nThe solution is then split up into chlorine, at the anode,\\nand sodium at the cathode. Sodium has a remarkably\\nstrong liking for water, and as soon as it is set free from\\nthe chlorine it combines with the water of the solution, and227\\na new solution of sodium hydrate is formed.

This method may be used for the preparation\\nof these two gases on a commercial scale, but more usually\\na solution of caustic soda is used as the electrolyte. If the\\noxygen and hydrogen are not to be used at the place where\\nthey are produced, they are forced under tremendous\\npressure into steel cylinders, and at a lantern lecture these\\ncylinders may be seen supplying the gas for the lime-light.\\nAlthough the cylinders are specially made and tested for\\nstrength, they are covered with a sort of rope netting; so\\nthat if by any chance one happened to burst, the shattered\\nfragments of metal would be caught by the netting, instead\\nof flying all over the room and possibly injuring a number\\nof people.

       " 'In the chapter on electricity in the atmosphere we saw that\\nwhereas air at ordinary pressure is a bad conductor, its\\nconducting power increases rapidly as the pressure is\\nlowered. Roughly speaking, if we wish to obtain a spark\\nacross a gap of 1 inch in ordinary air, we must have an\\nelectric pressure of about 50,000 volts. The discharge\\nwhich takes place under these conditions is very violent,\\nand it is called a “disruptive” discharge. If however the\\nair pressure is gradually lowered, the discharge loses its\\nviolent character, and the brilliant spark is replaced by a\\nsoft, luminous glow.',\n",
       " 'The changes in the character of the discharge may be\\nstudied by means of an apparatus known as the “electric\\negg.” This consists of an egg-shaped bulb of glass, having\\nits base connected with an air-pump. Two brass rods\\nproject into the bulb, one at each end; the lower rod being\\na fixture, while the upper one is arranged to slide in and\\nout, so that the distance between the balls can be varied.\\nThe outer ends of the rods are connected to an induction\\ncoil or to a Wimshurst machine. If the distance between\\nthe balls has to be, say, half an inch, to produce a spark\\nwith the air at normal pressure, then on slightly reducing\\nthe pressure by means of the air-pump it is found that a\\nspark will pass with the balls an inch or more apart. The\\nbrilliance of an electric spark is due to the resistance of the229\\nair, and as the pressure decreases the resistance becomes\\nsmaller, so that the light produced is much less brilliant.\\nIf the exhaustion is carried still further the discharge\\nbecomes redder in colour, and spreads out wider and wider\\nuntil it loses all resemblance to a spark, and becomes a\\nluminous glow of a purple or violet colour. At first this\\nglow seems to fill the whole bulb, but at still higher vacua\\nit contracts into layers of definite shape, these layers being\\nalternately light and dark. Finally, when the pressure\\nbecomes equal to about one-millionth of an atmosphere, a\\nluminous glow surrounds the cathode or negative rod,\\nbeyond this is dark space almost filling the bulb, and the\\nwalls of the bulb between the cathode and the anode\\nglow with phosphorescent light. This phosphorescence is\\nproduced by rays coming from the cathode and passing\\nthrough the dark space, and these rays have been given the\\nname of “cathode rays.”',\n",
       " 'Many interesting experiments with these rays may be\\nperformed with tubes permanently exhausted to the proper\\ndegree. The power of the rays to produce phosphorescence\\nis shown in a most striking way with a tube fixed in a\\nhorizontal position upon a stand, and containing a light\\ncross made of aluminium, placed in the path of the rays.\\nThis is hinged at the base, so that it can be stood up on end\\nor thrown down by jerking the tube. Some of the rays\\nstreaming from the cathode are intercepted by the cross,\\nwhile others pass by it and reach the other end of the tube.\\nThe result is that a black shadow of the cross is thrown on\\nthe glass, sharply contrasted with those parts of the tube\\nreached by the rays, and which phosphoresce brilliantly.\\nAfter a little while this brilliance decreases, for the glass\\nbecomes fatigued, and loses to a considerable extent its\\npower of phosphorescing. If now the cross is jerked down,\\nthe rays reach the portions of the tube before protected by230\\nthe cross, and this glass, being quite fresh, phosphoresces\\nwith full brilliance. The black cross now suddenly becomes\\nbrilliantly illuminated, while the tired glass is dark in\\ncomparison. If the tired glass is allowed to rest for a while\\nit partly recovers its phosphorescing powers, but it never\\nregains its first brilliance.',\n",

       " 'For a long time the nature of these cathode rays was in\\ndispute. German physicists held that they were of the same\\ncharacter as ordinary light, while English scientists, headed\\nby Sir William Crookes, maintained that they were streams\\nof extremely minute particles of matter in a peculiar fourth\\nstate. That is to say, the matter was not liquid, or solid, or\\ngaseous in the ordinary sense, but was ultra-gaseous, and\\nCrookes gave it the name of radiant matter. Most of us\\nhave been taught to look upon the atom as the smallest\\npossible division of matter, but recent researches have made\\nit clear that the atom itself is divisible. It is believed that\\nan atom is made up of very much more minute particles\\ncalled electrons, which are moving about or revolving all the\\ntime with incredible rapidity. According to Sir Oliver\\nLodge, if we imagine an atom of hydrogen to be as big as\\nan ordinary church, then the electrons which constitute it\\nwill be represented by about 700 grains of sand, 350 being\\npositively electrified and 350 negatively electrified. It is not\\nyet definitely determined whether these electrons are minute231\\nparticles of matter charged with electricity, or whether they\\nare actually atoms of electricity. The majority of scientists\\nnow believe that the cathode rays consist of a stream of\\nnegative electrons repelled from the cathode at a speed of\\n124 miles per second, or not quite 1/1000 of the velocity of\\nlight.',\n",

These\\nwere not cathode rays, because they were able to pass\\nthrough the glass, and were not deflected by a magnet.

The\\nrays also were found to cause certain chemical compounds\\nto become luminous. A cardboard screen covered with\\none of these compounds is quite opaque to ordinary light,\\nbut if it is examined when the Röntgen rays are falling\\nupon it, it is seen to be brightly illuminated, and if the\\nhand is held between the screen and the rays the bones\\nbecome clearly visible.',\n",

Fig. 38 shows\\na typical form of simple X-ray tube.

The cathode C is made of aluminium, and is\\nshaped like a saucer, its curvature being arranged so that\\nthe cathode rays are focused on to the anti-cathode A.\\nThe focusing as a rule is not done very accurately, for\\nalthough sharper radiographs are obtained when the cathode\\nrays converge exactly to a point on the anti-cathode, the\\nheating effect at this point is so great that a hole is quickly\\nburned. The target, or surface of the anti-cathode, is\\nmade of some metal having an extremely high melting-point,\\nsuch as platinum, iridium, or tungsten. It has a flat\\nsurface inclined at an angle of about 45°, so that the rays\\nemanating from it proceed in the direction shown by the\\ndotted lines in the figure.

It\\nshould be remembered\\nthat the\\nterms high and\\nlow, as applied to\\nthe vacuum of X-ray\\ntubes, are only\\nrelative, because\\nthe vacuum must\\nbe very high to admit of the production of X-rays at all.\\nThe vacuum becomes higher as the tube is used, and after a\\nwhile it becomes so high that the tube is practically useless,\\nfor the penetrating power of the rays is then so great that\\nsharp contrasts between different substances, such as flesh\\nand bone, cannot be obtained, and the resulting radiographs\\nare flat and poor. The vacuum of a hard tube may be\\nlowered temporarily by gently heating the tube, but this is\\nnot a very convenient or satisfactory process, and tubes are\\nnow made with special arrangements for lowering the\\nvacuum when necessary.

The vacuum is lowered while the discharges are\\npassing through the tube. The wire DF is moved towards\\nthe cathode terminal B, and kept there for a few seconds.\\nSparks pass between F and B, and the current is now\\npassing through the electrode D in the regulator chamber.\\nThis causes the mica to become heated, so that it gives off\\na small quantity of gas, which passes into the main tube\\nand so lowers the vacuum.

As\\nearly as the year 1899 Finsen had employed his light\\ntreatment in 350 cases of lupus, and out of this number\\nonly five cases were unsuccessful.',\n",

Experiments carried out in Paris,\\nusing a mercury vapour lamp as the source of light, show\\nthat discoloured teeth are whitened and given a pearly\\nlustre by these rays, at the same time being sterilized so\\nthat they do not easily decay. The Röntgen rays are\\nused for the treatment of lupus, and more particularly for\\ndeeper growths, such as tumours and cancers, for which\\nthe Finsen rays are useless, owing to their lack of penetrating\\npower. The action of these two kinds of rays appears\\nto be similar, but the X-rays are much the more active of\\nthe two.',\n",

       " 'As far back as 1785 it was noticed that oxygen became\\nchanged in some way when an electric spark was passed\\nthrough it, and that it acquired a peculiar odour. No\\nparticular attention was paid to the matter however until\\nabout 1840, when Schönbein, a famous German chemist, and\\nthe discoverer of gun-cotton and collodion, became interested\\nin it. He gave this strange smelling substance the name\\nof “ozone,” and he published the results of his experiments\\nwith it in a treatise entitled, “On the Generation of\\nOzone.” Schönbein showed that ozone could be produced\\nby various methods, chemical as well as electrical. For\\ninstance, if a piece of phosphorus is suspended in a jar of\\nair containing also a little water, in such a manner that it\\nis partly in the water and partly out of it, the air acquires\\nthe characteristic smell of ozone, and it is found to have\\ngained increased chemical energy, so that it is a more248\\npowerful oxidizing agent. For a long time the exact\\nchemical nature of ozone could not be determined, mainly\\nbecause it was impossible to obtain the substance in\\nquantities sufficiently large for extensive experimental\\nresearch, but also on account of its extremely energetic\\nproperties, which made it very troublesome to examine.\\nThese difficulties were so great that investigators were in\\ndoubt as to whether ozone was an element or a compound\\nof two or more elements; but finally it was proved that it\\nwas simply oxygen in a condensed or concentrated state.',\n",

No ozone can be detected\\nin the air of large towns, or over unhealthy swamps or249\\nmarshes.

This is a\\nmistake, for besides being tasteless and odourless, carbonic\\nacid gas is practically harmless, except in quantities far\\ngreater than ever exist even in the worst ventilated rooms.\\nThe real source of the tainted air is the great amount of\\nanimal matter thrown off as waste products from the skin\\nand lungs, and this tainting is further intensified by the\\nabsence of motion in the air. Even in an over-crowded\\nroom the conditions are made much more bearable if the\\nair is kept in motion, and in a close room ladies obtain\\nrelief by the use of their fans.

       " 'In the well-known “Ozonair” system of ventilation,\\nozone is generated by high-tension current. Low-tension\\ncurrent is taken from the public mains or from accumulators,\\nand raised to a very high voltage by passing it through a\\nstep-up transformer. The secondary terminals of the\\ntransformer are connected to a special form of condenser,\\nconsisting of layers of fine metal gauze separated by an\\ninsulating substance called “micanite.” The high tension\\nbetween the gauze layers produces a silent electrical discharge250\\nor glow. A small fan worked by an electric motor\\ndraws the air over the condenser plates, and so a certain\\nproportion of the oxygen is ozonized, and is driven out of\\nthe other side of the apparatus into the room. The amount\\nof ozone generated and the amount of air drawn over the\\ncondenser are regulated carefully, so that the ozonized air\\ncontains rather less than one volume of ozone in one\\nmillion volumes of air, experiment having shown that this\\nis the most suitable strength for breathing. Ozone diluted\\nto this degree has a slight odour which is very refreshing,\\nand besides diminishing the number of organic germs in\\nthe air, it neutralizes unpleasant smells, such as arise from\\ncooking or stale tobacco smoke.

Air is drawn in as shown by the arrows, and\\nby passing through the filter screen F it is freed from dirt\\nand smuts, and from most of the injurious gases which\\nalways are present in town air. The filter screen is kept\\nmoist by a continual flow of water from jets above it, the\\nwaste water falling into the trough W. The ozone\\ngenerator is shown at O. Continuous current at about\\n500 volts, from the power station, is passed through a\\nrotary converter, which turns it into alternating current at\\n380 volts. This current goes to the transformer T, from252\\nwhich it emerges at a pressure of 5000 volts, and is supplied\\nto the ozone generator. From the generator the strongly\\nozonized air is taken by way of the ozone pipe P, to the\\nmixing chamber of the large ventilating fan M, where it is\\nmixed with the main air current and then blown down the\\nmain air trunk.

Combustion means\\nthe operation of burning, and an internal-combustion engine\\nis one in which the motive power is produced by the combustion\\nof a highly explosive mixture of gases. In the\\nordinary petrol motor this mixture consists of petrol and air,\\nand it is made by means of a device called a “carburetter.”\\nBy suction, a quantity of petrol is forced through a jet with\\na very fine nozzle, so that it is reduced to an extremely fine\\nspray. A certain proportion of air is allowed to enter, and\\nthe mixture passes into the cylinder. Here it is compressed\\nby the rising piston so that it becomes more and more\\nheated, and at the right point it is ignited. Combustion\\ntakes place with such rapidity that it takes the form of an\\nexplosion, and the energy produced in this way drives\\nforward the piston, which turns the crank-shaft and so\\ncommunicates motion to the driving-wheels.',\n",
       " 'The part played by electricity in this process is confined\\nto the ignition of the compressed charge of petrol and air.\\nThis may be done in two ways; by means of an accumulator\\nand a small induction coil, or by means of a dynamo driven\\nby the engine.

This current\\ngoes through a sparking plug, which is fixed in the head\\nof the cylinder. The sparking plug contains two metal\\npoints separated by a tiny air gap of from about 1/30 to 1/50\\ninch. This gap provides the only possible path for the\\nhigh-tension current, so that the latter leaps across it in\\nthe form of a spark. The spark is arranged to take place\\nwhen the piston is at the top of its stroke, that is, when the\\nexplosive mixture is at its maximum compression, and the\\nheat of the spark ignites the mixture, the resulting explosion\\nforcing down the piston with great power. In practice it\\nis found better as a rule to cause the spark to pass very\\nslightly before the piston reaches the extreme limit of its\\nstroke. The reason of this is that the process of igniting\\nand exploding the charge occupies an appreciable, though\\nof course exceedingly small amount of time. Immediately\\non reaching the top of its stroke the piston begins to\\ndescend again, and if the spark and the top of the stroke\\ncoincide in time the explosion does not take place until the\\npiston has moved some little distance down the cylinder,\\nand so a certain amount of power is lost. By having the\\nspark a little in advance of the piston, the explosion occurs\\nat the instant when the piston begins to return, and so the\\nfull force of the explosion is utilized.',\n",
       " 'In magneto ignition the current is supplied by a small\\ndynamo. This generates alternating current, and it is\\ndriven by the car engine. The current is at first at low\\npressure, and it has to be transformed to high-tension\\ncurrent in order to produce the spark. There are two\\nmethods of effecting this transformation. One is by turning255\\nthe armature of the dynamo into a sort of induction coil, by\\ngiving it two separate windings, primary and secondary;\\nso that the dynamo delivers high-tension current directly.\\nThe other method is to send the low-tension current\\nthrough one or more transformer coils, just as in accumulator\\nignition. Accumulators can give current only for a\\ncertain limited period, and they are liable consequently to\\nrun down at inconvenient times and places. They also\\nhave the defect of undergoing a slight leakage of current\\neven when they are not in use. Magneto ignition has\\nneither of these drawbacks, and on account of its superior\\nreliability it has come into universal use.',\n",

In dull\\nweather this discharge is at its minimum, but under the\\ninfluence of bright sunshine it goes on with full vigour. It\\nis not known exactly how this discharge affects the plant,\\nbut apparently it assists its development in some way, and\\nthere is no doubt that when the discharge is at its maximum\\nthe flow of sap is most vigorous.

This coil\\nis fitted with a spark gap, and the high-tension current goes\\nthrough four or five vacuum valve globes, the invention\\nof Sir Oliver Lodge, which permit the current to pass\\nthrough them in one direction only.

These are arranged to pass only the positive\\ncurrent, and this current is led to overhead wires out in the\\nfield to be electrified. Lemström used wires at a height of\\n18 inches from the ground, but these were very much in\\nthe way, and in the Lodge-Newman system the main wires\\nare carried on large porcelain insulators fixed at the top of\\npoles at a height of about 15 feet.

       " 'One of the great advantages of living in a town is the\\nabundant supply of gas and water. These necessary\\nsubstances are conveyed to us along underground pipes,\\nand a large town has miles upon miles of such pipes,\\nextending in all directions and forming a most complex\\nnetwork. Gas and water companies keep a record of these\\npipes, with the object of finding any pipe quickly when the\\nnecessity arises; but in spite of such records pipes are\\noften lost, especially where the whole face of the neighbourhood\\nhas changed since the pipes were laid. The finding\\nof a lost pipe by digging is a very troublesome process, and\\neven when the pipe is known to be close at hand, it is quite\\nsurprising how many attempts are frequently necessary\\nbefore it can be located, and its course traced. As may be\\nimagined, this is an expensive business, and often it has been\\nfound cheaper to lay a new length of pipe than to find the\\nold one. There is now an electrical method by which pipe\\nlocating is made comparatively simple, and unless it is very\\nexceptionally deep down, a pipe never need be abandoned\\non account of difficulty in tracing it.',\n",
       " 'The mechanism of an electric pipe locator is not at all\\ncomplicated, consisting only of an induction coil with\\nbattery, and a telephone receiver connected to a coil of a\\nlarge number of turns of thin copper wire. If a certain267\\nsection of a pipe is lost, and has to be located, operations\\nare commenced from some fitting known to be connected\\nwith it, and from some other fitting which may or may not\\nbe connected with the pipe, but which is believed to be so\\nconnected. The induction coil is set working, and its\\nsecondary terminals are connected one to each of these\\nfittings. If the second fitting is connected with the pipe,\\nthen the whole length of the pipe between these two points\\nis traversed by the high-frequency current. The searcher,\\nwearing the head telephone receiver, with the coil hanging\\ndown from it so as to be close to the ground, walks to and\\nfro over the ground beneath which the pipe must lie.\\nWhen he approaches the pipe the current passing through\\nthe latter induces a similar current in the suspended coil,\\nand this produces a sort of buzzing or humming sound in\\nthe telephone. The nearer he approaches to the pipe the\\nlouder is the humming, and it reaches its maximum when\\nhe is standing directly over the pipe. In this way the\\nwhole course of the pipe can be traced without any digging,\\neven when the pipe is 15 or 20 feet down. The absence\\nof any sounds in the receiver indicates that the second\\nfitting is not on the required pipe line, and other fittings\\nhave to be tried until one on this line is found.',\n",
       " 'Amongst the many dangers to which ships crossing the\\nAtlantic are exposed is that of collision with icebergs.\\nThese are large masses of ice which have become detached\\nfrom the mighty ice-fields of the north, and which travel\\nslowly and majestically southwards, growing smaller and\\nsmaller as they pass into warmer seas. Icebergs give no\\nwarning of their coming, and in foggy weather, which is very\\nprevalent in the regions where they are encountered, they268\\nare extremely difficult to see until they are at dangerously\\nclose quarters.',\n",
       " 'Attempts have been made to detect the proximity of\\nicebergs by noting the variations in the temperature of the\\nwater. We naturally should expect the temperature of the\\nwater to become lower as we approach a large berg, and\\nthis is usually the case. On the other hand, it has been\\nfound that in many instances the temperature near an\\niceberg is quite as high as, and sometimes higher than the\\naverage temperature of the ocean. For this reason the\\ntemperature test, taken by itself, is not at all reliable. A\\nmuch more certain test is that of the salinity or saltness of\\nthe water. Icebergs are formed from fresh water, and as\\nthey gradually melt during their southward journey the\\nfresh water mixes with the sea water. Consequently the\\nwater around an iceberg is less salt than the water of the\\nopen ocean. The saltness of water may be determined by\\ntaking its specific gravity, or by various chemical processes;\\nbut while these tests are quite satisfactory when performed\\nunder laboratory conditions, they cannot be carried out at sea\\nwith any approach to accuracy. There is however an electrical\\ntest which can be applied accurately and continuously.\\nThe electrical conducting power of water varies greatly with\\nthe proportion of salt present. If the conductivity of normal\\nAtlantic water be taken as 1000, then the conductivity of\\nThames water is 8, and that of distilled water about 1/22.\\nThe difference in conductivity between normal ocean water\\nand water in the vicinity of an iceberg is therefore very great.',\n",
       " 'The apparatus for detecting differences in salinity by\\nmeasuring the conductivity of the water is called a “salinometer,”\\nand its most perfect form, known as the heat-compensated\\nconductivity salinometer, is due to Dr. Myer\\nCoplans. Fig. 43 shows a diagram of this interesting\\npiece of apparatus, which is most ingeniously devised. Two270\\ninsulated electrodes of copper, with platinum points, are\\nsuspended in a U-tube through which the sea water passes\\ncontinuously, as indicated in the diagram. A steady current\\nis passed through the column of water between the two\\nplatinum points, and the conductivity of this column is\\nmeasured continuously by very accurate instruments.\\nVariations in the conductivity, indicating corresponding\\nvariations in the saltness of the water, are thus shown\\nimmediately; but before these indications can be relied\\nupon the instrument must be compensated for temperature,\\nbecause the conductivity of the water increases with a rise,\\nand decreases with a fall in temperature. This compensation\\nis effected by the compound bars of brass and steel\\nshown in the vessel at the right of the figure. These bars\\nare connected with the wheel and disc from which the\\nelectrodes are suspended. When the temperature of the\\nwater rises, the bars contract, and exert a pull upon the\\nwheel and disc, so that the electrodes are raised slightly in\\nthe U-tube. This increases the length of the column of\\nwater between the platinum points, and so increases the\\nresistance, or, what amounts to the same thing, lowers the\\nconductivity, in exact proportion to the rise in temperature.\\nSimilarly, a fall in temperature lowers the electrodes, and\\ndecreases the resistance by shortening the column of water.\\nIn this way the conductivity of the water remains constant\\nso far as temperature is concerned, and it varies only with\\nthe saltness of the water. Under ordinary conditions a\\nconsiderable decrease in the salinity of the water indicates\\nthe existence of ice in the near neighbourhood, but the\\ngeographical position of the ship has to be taken into\\naccount. Rivers such as the St. Lawrence pour vast\\nquantities of fresh water into the ocean, and the resulting\\ndecrease in the saltness of the water within a considerable\\nradius of the mouth of the river must be allowed for.',\n",

       " 'Considerable interest was aroused last year by a model\\nof a railway working upon a very remarkable system. This\\nwas the invention of Mr. Emile Bachelet, and the model\\nwas brought to London from the United States. The main\\nprinciple upon which the system is based is interesting.\\nAbout 1884, Professor Elihu Thompson, a famous American\\nscientist, made the discovery that a plate of copper could be\\nattracted or repelled by an electro-magnet. The effects\\ntook place at the moment when the magnetism was varied\\nby suddenly switching the current on or off; the copper\\nbeing repelled when the current was switched on, and\\nattracted when it was switched off. Copper is a non-magnetic\\nsubstance, and the attraction and repulsion are\\nnot ordinary magnetic effects, but are due to currents\\ninduced in the copper plate at the instant of producing or\\ndestroying the magnetism. The plate is attracted or\\nrepelled according to whether these induced currents flow in\\nthe same direction as, or in the opposite direction to, the\\ncurrent in the magnet coil. Brass and aluminium plates\\nact in the same way as the copper plate, and the effects are\\nproduced equally well by exciting the magnet with alternating\\ncurrent, which, by changing its direction, changes the\\nmagnetism also. Of the two effects, the repulsion is\\nmuch the stronger, especially if the variations in the\\nmagnetism take place very rapidly; and if a powerful\\nand rapidly alternating current is used, the plate is repelled\\nso strongly that it remains supported in mid-air above the\\nmagnet.',\n",
       " 'This repulsive effect is utilized in the Bachelet system\\n(Plate XV.). There are no rails in the ordinary sense, and\\nthe track is made up of a continuous series of electro-magnets.272\\nThe car, which is shaped something like a cigar,\\nhas a floor of aluminium, and contains an iron cylinder,\\nand it runs above the line of magnets. Along each side\\nof the track is a channel guide rail, and underneath the car\\nat each end are fixed two brushes with guide pieces, which\\nrun in the guide rails. Above the car is a third guide rail,\\nand two brushes with guide pieces fixed on the top of the\\ncar, one at each end, run in this overhead rail. These\\nguide rails keep the car in position, and also act as conductors\\nfor the current. The repulsive action of the\\nelectro-magnets upon the aluminium floor raises the car\\nclear of the track, and keeps it suspended; and while\\nremaining in this mid-air position it is driven, or rather\\npulled forward, by powerful solenoids, which are supplied\\nwith continuous current. We have referred previously to\\nthe way in which a solenoid draws into it a core of iron.\\nWhen the car enters a solenoid, the latter exerts a pulling\\ninfluence upon the iron cylinder inside the car, and so the\\ncar is given a forward movement. This is sufficient to\\ncarry it along to the next solenoid, which gives it another\\npull, and so the car is drawn forward from one solenoid\\nto another to the end of the line. The model referred\\nto has only a short track of about 30 feet, with one\\nsolenoid at each end; but its working shows that the\\npulling power of the solenoids is sufficient to propel the\\ncar.',\n",
       " 'To avoid the necessity of keeping the whole of the\\nelectro-magnets energized all the time, these are arranged\\nin sections, which are energized separately. By means of\\nthe lower set of brushes working in the track guides, each\\nof these sections has alternating current supplied to it as\\nthe car approaches, and switched off from it when the car\\nhas passed. The brushes working in the overhead guide\\nsupply continuous current to each solenoid as the car enters\\nit, and switch off the current when the car has passed\\nthrough. The speed at which the model car travels is\\nquite extraordinary, and the inventor believes that in actual\\npractice speeds of more than 300 miles an hour are attainable\\non his system.',\n",

The chief difficulty with aeroplanes lies in the\\naerial. This must take the form either of a long trailing\\nwire or of fixed wires running between the planes and the\\ntail. A trailing wire is open to the objection that it is\\nliable to get mixed up with the propeller, besides which it\\nappears likely to hamper to some slight extent the movements\\nof a small and light machine.

A further trouble with\\naeroplanes lies in the tremendous noise made by the\\nengine, which frequently makes it quite impossible to hear\\nincoming signals; and the only way of getting over this\\ndifficulty appears to be for the operator to wear some sort\\nof sound-proof head-gear.

Harbour defence mines are almost invariably electrically\\ncontrolled; that is, they are connected with the shore\\nby means of a cable, and fired by an electric impulse sent\\nalong that cable. In one system of control the moment of\\nfiring is determined entirely by observers on shore, who,\\naided by special optical instruments, are able to tell exactly\\nwhen a vessel is above any particular mine. The actual\\nfiring is carried out by depressing a key which completes\\nan electric circuit, thus sending a current along the cable\\nto actuate the exploding mechanism inside the mine. A\\nhostile ship therefore would be blown up on arriving at the\\ncritical position, while a friendly vessel would be allowed\\nto pass on in safety. In this system of control there is no\\ncontact between the vessel and the mine, the latter being\\nwell submerged or resting on the sea floor, so that the\\nharbour is not obstructed in any way. This is a great\\nadvantage, but against it must be set possible failure of the\\ndefence at a critical moment owing to thick weather, which\\nof course interferes seriously with the careful observation\\nof the mine field necessary for accurate timing of the explosions.\\nThis difficulty may be surmounted by a contact\\nsystem of firing. In this case the mines are placed so near\\nthe surface as to make contact with vessels passing over\\nthem. The observers on shore are informed of the contact\\nby means of an electric impulse automatically transmitted\\nalong the cable, so that they are independent of continuous\\nvisual observation of the mined area. As in the previous\\nsystem, the observers give the actual firing impulse. The\\ndrawback to this method is the necessity for special pilotage\\narrangements for friendly ships in order to avoid unnecessary\\nstriking of the mines, which are liable to have their\\nmechanism deranged by constant blows. If the harbour or285\\nchannel can be closed entirely to friendly shipping, the\\nobservers may be dispensed with, their place being taken\\nby automatic electric apparatus which fires at once any mine\\nstruck by a vessel.',\n",

The blow\\ngiven by a ship may be made to withdraw a pin, thus\\nreleasing a sort of plunger, which, actuated by a powerful\\nspring, detonates the charge. A similar result is obtained\\nby the use of a suspended weight, in place of plunger and\\nspring. Still another form of mine is fired electrically by\\nmeans of a battery, the circuit of which is closed automatically\\nby the percussion. Deep-sea mines may be anchored\\nor floating free. Free mines are particularly dangerous on\\naccount of the impossibility of knowing where they may be\\nat any given moment. They are liable to drift for considerable\\ndistances, and to pass into neutral seas; and to\\nsafeguard neutral shipping international rules require them\\nto have some sort of clockwork mechanism which renders\\nthem harmless after a period of one hour. It is quite\\ncertain that some, at least, of the German free mines have\\nno such mechanism, so that neutral shipping is greatly\\nendangered.',\n",

In years to come the tireless labours of\\nscientific investigators may lead to a solution of the problem;\\nbut, as Professor Fleming puts it: “The question—What\\nis electricity?—no more admits of a complete and final\\nanswer to-day than does the question—What is life?”',\n",
       " 'From the earliest days of electrical science theories of\\nelectricity have been put forward. The gradual extension\\nand development of these theories, and the constant substitution\\nof one idea for another as experimental data\\nincreased, provide a fascinating subject for study. To\\ncover this ground however, even in outline, would necessitate\\nmany chapters, and so it will be better to consider\\nonly the theory which, with certain reservations in some\\ncases, is held by the scientific world of to-day. This is\\nknown as the electron theory of electricity.',\n",
       " 'We have referred already, in Chapter XXIV., to atoms\\nand electrons. All matter is believed to be constituted\\nof minute particles called “atoms.” These atoms are so\\nextremely small that they are quite invisible, being far\\nbeyond the range of the most powerful microscope; and\\ntheir diameter has been estimated at somewhere about one288\\nmillionth of a millimetre. Up to a few years ago the atom\\nwas believed to be quite indivisible, but it has been proved\\nbeyond doubt that this is not the case. An atom may be\\nsaid to consist of two parts, one much larger than the\\nother. The smaller part is negatively electrified, and is\\nthe same in all atoms; while the larger part is positively\\nelectrified, and varies according to the nature of the atom.\\nThe small negatively electrified portion of the atom consists of\\nparticles called “electrons,” and these electrons are believed\\nto be indivisible units or atoms of negative electricity. To\\nquote Professor Fleming: “An atom of matter in its neutral\\ncondition has been assumed to consist of an outer shell or\\nenvelope of negative electrons associated with some core or\\nmatrix which has an opposite electrical quality, such that if\\nan electron is withdrawn from the atom the latter is left\\npositively electrified.”',\n",
       " 'The electrons in an atom are not fixed, but move with\\ngreat velocity, in definite orbits. They repel one another,\\nand are constantly endeavouring to fly away from the atom,\\nbut they are held in by the attraction of the positive core.\\nSo long as nothing occurs to upset the constitution of the\\natom, a state of equilibrium is maintained and the atom is\\nelectrically neutral; but immediately the atom is broken up\\nby the action of an external force of some kind, one or\\nmore electrons break their bonds and fly away to join some\\nother atom. An atom which has lost some of its electrons\\nis no longer neutral, but is electro-positive; and similarly,\\nan atom which has gained additional electrons is electro-negative.\\nElectrons, or atoms of negative electricity, can\\nbe isolated from atoms of matter, as in the case of the\\nstream of electrons proceeding from the cathode of a vacuum\\ntube. So far, however, it has been found impossible to\\nisolate corresponding atoms of positive electricity.',\n",
       " 'From these facts it appears that we must regard a289\\npositively charged body as possessing a deficiency of\\nelectrons, and a negatively charged body as possessing an\\nexcess of electrons. In Chapter I. we spoke of the\\nelectrification of sealing-wax or glass rods by friction, and\\nwe saw that according to the nature of the substance used\\nas the rubber, the rods were either positively or negatively\\nelectrified. Apparently, when we rub a glass rod with a\\npiece of silk, the surface atoms of each substance are\\ndisturbed, and a certain number of electrons leave the glass\\natoms, and join the silk atoms. The surface atoms of the\\nglass, previously neutral, are now electro-positive through\\nthe loss of electrons; and the surface atoms of the silk,\\nalso previously neutral, are now electro-negative through\\nthe additional electrons received from the glass atoms.\\nAs the result we find the glass to be positively, and silk to\\nbe negatively electrified. On the other hand, if we rub the\\nglass with fur, a similar atomic disturbance and consequent\\nmigration of electrons takes place, but this time the glass\\nreceives electrons instead of parting with them. In this case\\nthe glass becomes negatively, and the fur positively electrified.\\nThe question now arises, why is the movement of the electrons\\naway from the glass in the first instance, and toward it in\\nthe second? To understand this we may make use of a\\nsimple analogy. If we place in contact two bodies, one hot\\nand the other cold, the hot body gives up some of its heat\\nto the cold body; but if we place in contact with the hot\\nbody another body which is still hotter, then the hot body\\nreceives heat instead of parting with it. In a somewhat\\nsimilar manner an atom is able to give some of its electrons\\nto another atom which, in comparison with it, is deficient in\\nelectrons; and at the same time it is able to receive electrons\\nfrom another atom which, compared with it, has an\\nexcess of electrons. Thus we may assume that the glass\\natoms have an excess of electrons as compared with290\\nsilk atoms, and a deficiency in electrons as compared with\\nfur atoms.',\n",
       " 'A current of electricity is believed to be nothing more\\nor less than a stream of electrons, set in motion by the\\napplication of an electro-motive force. We have seen that\\nsome substances are good conductors of electricity, while\\nothers are bad conductors or non-conductors. In order to\\nproduce an electric current, that is a current of electrons, it\\nis evidently necessary that the electrons should be free to\\nmove. In good conductors, which are mostly metals, it is\\nbelieved that the electrons are able to move from atom to\\natom without much hindrance, while in a non-conductor\\ntheir movements are hampered to such an extent that inter-atomic\\nexchange of electrons is almost impossible. Speaking on\\nthis point, Professor Fleming says: “There may be (in\\na good conductor) a constant decomposition and recomposition\\nof atoms taking place, and any given electron so to\\nspeak flits about, now forming part of one atom and now of\\nanother, and anon enjoying a free existence. It resembles\\na person visiting from house to house, forming a unit in\\ndifferent households, and, in between, being a solitary\\nperson in the street. In non-conductors, on the other hand,\\nthe electrons are much restricted in their movements, and\\ncan be displaced a little way but are pulled back again\\nwhen released.”',\n",
       " 'Let us try to see now how an electric current is set up\\nin a simple voltaic cell, consisting of a zinc plate and a\\ncopper plate immersed in dilute acid. First we must\\nunderstand the meaning of the word ion. If we place a\\nsmall quantity of salt in a vessel containing water, the salt\\ndissolves, and the water becomes salt, not only at the\\nbottom where the salt was placed, but throughout the\\nwhole vessel. This means that the particles of salt must be\\nable to move through the water. Salt is a chemical291\\ncompound of sodium and chlorine, and its molecules\\nconsist of atoms of both these substances. It is supposed\\nthat each salt molecule breaks up into two parts, one part\\nbeing a sodium atom, and the other a chlorine atom; and\\nfurther, that the sodium atom loses an electron, while the\\nchlorine atom gains one. These atoms have the power of\\ntravelling about through the solution, and they are called\\nions, which means “wanderers.” An ordinary atom is unable\\nto wander about in this way, but it gains travelling power\\nas soon as it is converted into an ion, by losing electrons if\\nit be an atom of a metal, and by gaining electrons if it be\\nan atom of a non-metal.',\n",
       " 'Returning to the voltaic cell, we may imagine that the\\natoms of the zinc which are immersed in the acid are trying\\nto turn themselves into ions, so that they can travel through\\nthe solution. In order to do this each atom parts with two\\nelectrons, and these electrons try to attach themselves to\\nthe next atom. This atom however already has two\\nelectrons, and so in order to accept the newcomers it must\\npass on its own two. In this way electrons are passed on\\nfrom atom to atom of the zinc, then along the connecting\\nwire, and so to the copper plate. The atoms of zinc which\\nhave lost their electrons thus become ions, with power of\\nmovement. They leave the zinc plate immediately, and so\\nthe plate wastes away or dissolves. So we get a constant\\nstream of electrons travelling along the wire connecting the\\ntwo plates, and this constitutes an electric current.',\n",
       " 'The electron theory gives us also a clear conception of\\nmagnetism. An electric current flowing along a wire\\nproduces magnetic effects; that is, it sets up a field of\\nmagnetic force. Such a current is a stream of electrons,\\nand therefore we conclude that a magnetic field is produced\\nby electrons in motion. This being so, we are led to\\nsuppose that there must be a stream of electrons in a steel292\\nmagnet, and this stream must be constant because the\\nmagnetic field of such a magnet is permanent. The\\nelectron stream in a permanent magnet however is not\\nquite the same as the electron stream in a wire conveying a\\ncurrent. We have stated that the electrons constituting an\\natom move in definite orbits, so that we may picture them\\ntravelling round the core of the atom as the planets travel\\nround the Sun. This movement is continuous in every\\natom of every substance. Apparently we have here the\\nnecessary conditions for the production of a magnetic field,\\nthat is, a constant stream of electrons; but one important\\nthing is still lacking. In an unmagnetized piece of steel the\\natoms are not arranged symmetrically, so that the orbits of\\ntheir electrons lie some in one plane and some in another.\\nConsequently, although the electron stream of each atom\\nundoubtedly produces an infinitesimally small magnetic\\nfield, no magnetic effect that we can detect is produced,\\nbecause the different streams are not working in unison and\\nadding together their forces. In fact they are upsetting\\nand neutralizing each other’s efforts. By stroking the piece\\nof steel with a magnet, or by surrounding it by a coil of\\nwire conveying a current, the atoms are turned so that their\\nelectron orbits all lie in the same plane. The electron\\nstreams now all work in unison, their magnetic effects are\\nadded together, and we get a strong magnetic field as the\\nresult of their combined efforts. Any piece of steel or iron\\nmay be regarded as a potential magnet, requiring only a\\nrearrangement of its atoms in order to become an active\\nmagnet. In Chapter VI. it was stated that other substances\\nbesides iron and steel show magnetic effects, and this is what\\nwe should expect, as the electron movement is common to\\nall atoms. None of these substances is equal to iron\\nand steel in magnetic power, but why this is so is not\\nunderstood.',\n",
       " '293',\n",
       " 'This brings us to the production of an electric current by\\nthe dynamo. Here we have a coil of wire moving across a\\nmagnetic field, alternately passing into this field and out of\\nit. A magnetic field is produced, as we have just seen, by\\nthe steady movement of electrons, and we may picture it\\nas being a region of the ether disturbed or strained by the\\neffect of the moving electrons. When the coil of wire\\npasses into the magnetic field, the electrons of its atoms are\\ninfluenced powerfully and set in motion in one direction, so\\nproducing a current in the coil. As the coil passes away\\nfrom the field, its electrons receive a second impetus, which\\nchecks their movement and starts them travelling in the\\nopposite direction, and another current is produced. The\\ncoil moves continuously and regularly, passing into and out\\nof the magnetic field without interruption; and so we get a\\ncurrent which reverses its direction at regular intervals, that\\nis, an alternating current. This current may be made continuous\\nif desired, as explained in Chapter IX.',\n",
       " 'Such, stated briefly and in outline, is the electron theory\\nof electricity. It opens up possibilities of the most fascinating\\nnature; it gives us a wonderfully clear conception of\\nwhat might be called the inner mechanism of electricity; and\\nit even introduces us to the very atoms of electricity.\\nBeyond this, at present, it cannot take us, and the actual\\nnature of electricity itself remains an enigma.']"

       " 'these early people had simple minds and from our point of view they had little intelligence but they possessed a great deal of curiosity they were just as anxious to explain things as we are and so they were not content until they had invented an explanation of lightning and thunder their favourite way of accounting for anything they did not understand was to make up a sort of romance about it they believed that the heavens were inhabited by various gods who showed their pleasure or anger by2 signs and so they naturally concluded that thunder was the voice of angry gods and lightning the weapon with which they struck down those who had displeased them prayers and sacrifices were therefore offered to the gods in the hope of appeasing their wrath ',\n",
       " 'greek and roman mythology contains many references to thunder and lightning for instance we read about the great god zeus who wielded thunder bolts which had been forged in underground furnaces by the giant cyclops there was no doubt that the thunder bolts were made in this way because one only had to visit a volcano in order to see the smoke from the furnace and hear the rumbling echo of the far off hammering then we are told the tragic story of phaeton son of the sun god this youth like many others since his time was daring and venturesome and imagined that he could do things quite as well as his father on one occasion he tried to drive his father s chariot and as might have been expected it got beyond his control and came dangerously near the earth the land was scorched the oceans were dried up and the whole earth was threatened with utter destruction in order to prevent such a frightful catastrophe jupiter the mighty lord of the heavens hurled a thunder bolt at phaeton and struck him from the chariot into the river po a whole book could be written about these ancient legends concerning the thunderstorm but interesting as they are they have no scientific value and many centuries were to elapse before the real nature of lightning was understood ',\n",
       " 'in order to trace the first glimmerings of electrical knowledge we must leave the thunderstorm and pass on to more trivial matters on certain sea coasts the ancients found a transparent yellow substance capable of taking a high polish and much to be desired as an ornament and about 600 years b c it was discovered that this substance 3 when rubbed gained the power of drawing to it bits of straw feathers and other light bodies this discovery is generally credited to a greek philosopher named thales 941 563 b c and it must be regarded as the first step towards the foundation of electrical science the yellow substance was amber we now know it to be simply a sort of fossilized resin but the greeks gave it a much more romantic origin when phaeton s rashness brought him to an untimely end his sorrowing sisters the heliades were changed into poplar trees and their tears into amber amongst the names given to the sun god was alector which means the shining one and so the tears of the heliades came to have the name electron or the shining thing unlike most of the old legends this story of the fate of the sun maidens is of great importance to us for from the word electron we get the name electricity ',\n",
       " 'thales and his contemporaries seem to have made no serious attempts to explain the attraction of the rubbed amber and indeed so little importance was attached to the discovery that it was completely forgotten about 321 b c one theophrastus found that a certain mineral called lyncurium gained attractive powers when rubbed but again little attention was paid to the matter and astonishing as it may seem no further progress worth mention was made until towards the close of the sixteenth century when doctor gilbert of colchester began to experiment seriously this man was born about 1543 and took his degree of doctor of medicine at cambridge in 1569 he was very successful in his medical work and became president of the college of physicians and later on physician to queen elizabeth he had a true instinct for scientific research and was not content to accept statements on the authority of others but tested everything for himself he found that sulphur resin sealing wax and many other substances4 behaved like amber when rubbed but he failed to get any results from certain other substances such as the metals he therefore called the former substances electrics and the latter anelectrics or non electrics his researches were continued by other investigators and from him dates the science of electricity ',\n",
       " 'leaving historical matters for the present we will examine the curious power which is gained by substances as the result of rubbing amber is not always obtainable and so we will use in its place a glass rod and a stick of sealing wax if the glass rod is rubbed briskly with a dry silk handkerchief and then held close to a number of very small bits of paper the bits are immediately drawn to the rod and the same thing occurs if the stick of sealing wax is substituted for the glass this power of attraction is due to the presence of a small charge of electricity on the rubbed glass and sealing wax or in other words the two substances are said to be electrified bits of paper are unsatisfactory for careful experimenting and instead of them we will use the simple piece of apparatus shown in fig 1 this consists of a ball of elder pith suspended from a glass support by means of a silk thread if now we repeat our experiments with the electrified glass or sealing wax we find that the little ball is attracted in the same way as the bits of paper but if we look carefully we shall notice that attraction is not the only effect for as soon as the ball touches the electrified body it is driven away or repelled now let us suspend by means of a thread a glass rod which has been electrified by rubbing it with silk and bring5 near it in turn another silk rubbed glass rod and a stick of sealing wax rubbed with flannel the two glass rods are found to repel one another whereas the sealing wax attracts the glass if the experiment is repeated with a suspended stick of sealing wax rubbed with flannel the glass and the sealing wax attract each other but the two sticks of wax repel one another both glass and sealing wax are electrified as may be seen by bringing them near the pith ball but there must be some difference between them as we get attraction in one case and repulsion in the other ',\n",

       " 'the kind of electricity produced depends not only on the substance rubbed but also on the material used as the rubber for instance we can give glass a negative charge by rubbing it with flannel and sealing wax becomes positively charged when rubbed with silk the important point to remember is that there are only two kinds of electricity and that every substance electrified by rubbing is charged either positively like the silk rubbed glass or negatively like the flannel rubbed sealing wax ',\n",

       " 'the principle upon which the machine works will be best understood by reference to fig 5 in this diagram the inner circle represents the front plate with neutralizing brushes a and b and the outer one represents the back plate with brushes c and d the sectors are shown heavily shaded e and f are the pairs of combs and the plates rotate in the direction of the arrows let us suppose one of the sectors at the top of the back plate to have a slight positive charge as the plates rotate this sector will come opposite to a front plate sector touched by brush a and it will induce a slight negative charge on the latter sector at the same time repelling a positive charge along the rod to the sector touched by brush b the two sectors carrying the induced charges now move on until opposite back plate sectors touched by brushes c and d and these back sectors will receive by induction positive and negative14 charges respectively this process continues as the plates rotate and finally all the sectors moving towards comb e will be positively charged while those approaching comb f will be negatively charged the combs collect these charges and the discharging rods k and l become highly electrified k positively and l negatively and if they are near enough together sparks will pass between them ',\n",
       " 'at the commencement we supposed one of the sectors to have a positive charge but it is not necessary to charge a sector specially for the machine is self starting why this is the case is not yet thoroughly understood but probably the explanation is that at any particular moment no two places in the atmosphere are in exactly the same15 electro static condition so that an uneven state of charge exists permanently amongst the sectors ',\n",
       " 'the wimshurst machine provides us with a plentiful supply of electricity and the question naturally arises can this electricity be stored up in any way in 1745 long before the days of influence machines a certain bishop of pomerania von kleist by name got the idea that if he could persuade a charge of electricity to go into a glass bottle he would be able to capture it because glass was a non conductor so he partly filled a bottle with water led a wire down into the water and while holding the bottle in one hand connected the wire to a primitive form of electric machine when he thought he had got enough electricity he tried to remove his bottle in order to examine the contents and in so doing he received a shock which scared him considerably he had succeeded in storing electricity in his bottle shortly afterwards the bishop s experiment was repeated by professor muschenbrock of leyden and by his pupil cuneus the former being so startled by the shock that he wrote i would not take a second shock for the kingdom of france but in spite of shocks the end was achieved it was proved that electricity could be collected and stored up and the bottle became known as the leyden jar the original idea was soon improved upon water being replaced by a coating of tinfoil and it was found that better results were obtained by coating the outside of the bottle as well as the inside ',\n",
       " 'as now used the leyden jar consists of a glass jar covered inside and outside with tinfoil up to about two thirds of its height a wooden lid is fitted through which passes a brass rod terminating above in a brass knob and below in a piece of brass chain long enough to touch the foil lining a leyden jar is charged by holding it in one hand with its knob presented to the discharging ball of a16 wimshurst machine and even if the machine is small and feeble the jar will accumulate electricity until it is very highly charged it may now be put down on the table and if it is clean and quite dry it will hold its charge for some time if the outer and inner coatings of the jar are connected by means of a piece of metal the electricity will be discharged in the form of a bright spark a leyden jar is usually discharged by means of discharging tongs consisting of a jointed brass rod with brass terminal knobs and glass handles one knob is placed in contact with the outer coating of foil and the other brought near to the knob of the jar which of course is connected with the inner coating ',\n",
       " 'the electrical capacity of even a small leyden jar is surprisingly great and this is due to the mutual attraction between opposite kinds of electricity if we stick a piece of tinfoil on the centre of each face of a pane of glass and charge one positively and the other negatively the two charges attract each other through the glass and in fact they hold on to each other so strongly that we can get very little electricity by touching either piece of foil this mutual attraction enables us to charge the two pieces of foil much more strongly than if they were each on a separate pane and this is the secret of the working of the leyden jar if the knob of the jar is held to the positive ball of a wimshurst the inside coating receives a positive charge which acts inductively on the outside coating attracting a negative charge to the inner face of the latter and repelling a positive charge to its outer face and thence away through the hand the electricity is entirely confined to the sides of the jar the interior having no charge whatever ',\n",
       " 'leyden jars are very often fitted to a wimshurst machine as shown at a a fig 4 and arranged so that they17 can be connected or disconnected to the collecting combs as desired when the jars are disconnected the machine gives a rapid succession of thin sparks but when the jars are connected to the combs they accumulate a number of charges before the discharge takes place with the result that the sparks are thicker but occur at less frequent intervals ',\n",
       " 'it will have been noticed that the rod of a leyden jar and the discharging rods of a wimshurst machine are made to terminate not in points but in rounded knobs or balls the reason of this is that electricity rapidly leaks away from points if we electrify a conductor shaped like a cone with a sharp point the density of the electricity is greatest at that point and when it becomes sufficiently great the particles of air near the point become electrified and repelled other particles take their place and are electrified and repelled in the same way and so a constant loss of electricity takes place this may be shown in an interesting way by fastening with wax a needle to the knob of a wimshurst if a lighted taper is held to the point of the needle while the machine is in action the flame is blown aside by the streams of repelled air which form a sort of electric wind ',\n",
       " 'if the leyden jars of a wimshurst machine are connected up and the discharging balls placed at a suitable distance apart the electricity produced by rotating the plates is discharged in the form of a brilliant zigzag spark between the balls accompanied by a sharp crack the resemblance between this spark and forked lightning is at once evident and in fact it is lightning in miniature the discharging balls are charged as we have seen with opposite kinds of electricity and these charges are constantly trying to reach one another across the intervening air which being an insulator vigorously opposes their passage there is thus a kind of struggle going on between the air and the two charges of electricity and this keeps the air in a state of constant strain but the resisting power of the air is limited and when the charges reach a certain strength the electricity violently forces its way across literally rupturing or splitting the air the particles of air along the path of the discharge are rendered incandescent by the heat produced by the passage of the electricity and so the brilliant flash is produced just as a river winds about seeking the easiest course so the electricity takes the path of least resistance which probably is determined by the particles of dust in the air and also by the density of the air which becomes compressed in front leaving less dense air and therefore an easier path on each side ',\n",

       " 'the connexion between lightning and the sparks from electrified bodies and electrical machines was suspected by many early observers but it remained for benjamin franklin to prove that lightning was simply a tremendous electric discharge by actually obtaining electricity from a thunder cloud franklin was an american born at boston in 1706 he was a remarkable man in every way and quite apart from his investigations in electricity will always be remembered for the great public services he rendered to his country in general and to philadelphia in particular he founded the philadelphia library the american philosophical society and the university of pennsylvania ',\n",
       " 'franklin noticed many similarities between electricity and lightning for instance both produced zigzag sparks both were conducted by metals both set fire to inflammable materials and both were capable of killing animals these resemblances appeared to him so striking that he was convinced that the two were the same and he resolved to put the matter to the test for this purpose he hit upon the idea of using a kite to the top of which was fixed a pointed wire at the lower end of the flying string was tied a key insulated by a piece of silk ribbon in june 1752 franklin flew his kite and after waiting a while he was rewarded by finding that when he brought his knuckle near to the key a little spark made its appearance this spark was exactly like the sparks obtained from electrified bodies but to make things quite certain a leyden jar was charged from the key various experiments were then performed with the jar and it was proved beyond all doubt that lightning and electricity were one and the same ',\n",
       " 'lightning is then an enormous electric spark between a cloud and the earth or between two clouds produced when opposite charges become so strong that they are able to break down the intervening non conducting layer of air 20 the surface of the earth is negatively electrified the electrification varying at different times and places while the electricity of the air is usually positive but frequently changes to negative in rainy weather and on other occasions as the clouds float about they collect the electricity from the air and thus they may be either positively or negatively electrified so that a discharge may take place between one cloud and another as well as between a cloud and the earth ',\n",
       " 'lightning flashes take different forms the commonest being forked or zigzag lightning and sheet lightning the zigzag form is due to the discharge taking the easiest path as in the case of the spark from a wimshurst machine sheet lightning is probably the reflection of a flash taking place at a distance it may be unaccompanied by thunder as in the so called summer lightning seen on the horizon at night which is the reflection of a storm too far off for the thunder to be heard a much rarer form is globular or ball lightning in which the discharge takes the shape of a ball of light which moves slowly along and finally disappears with a sudden explosion the cause of this form of lightning is not yet understood but it is possible that the ball of light consists of intensely heated and extremely minute fragments of ordinary matter torn off by the violence of the lightning discharge another uncommon form is multiple lightning which consists of a number of separate parallel discharges having the appearance of a ribbon ',\n",
       " 'a lightning flash probably lasts from about 1 100 000 to 1 1 000 000 of a second and in the majority of cases the discharge is oscillatory that is to say it passes several times backwards and forwards between two clouds or between a cloud and the earth at times it appears as though we could see the lightning start downwards from the cloud or upwards from the earth but this is an optical illusion and21 it is really quite impossible to tell at which end the flash starts ',\n",
       " 'death by lightning is instantaneous and therefore quite painless we are apt to think that pain is felt at the moment when a wound is inflicted this is not the case however for no pain is felt until the impression reaches the brain by way of the nerves and this takes an appreciable time the nerves transmit sensations at a speed of only about one hundred feet per second so that in the case of a man killed by a bullet through the brain no pain would be felt because the brain would be deprived of sensibility before the sensation could reach it lightning is infinitely swifter than any bullet so life would be destroyed by it before any pain could be felt ',\n",
       " 'on one occasion professor tyndall the famous physicist received accidentally a very severe shock from a large battery of leyden jars while giving a public lecture his account of his sensations is very interesting life was absolutely blotted out for a very sensible interval without a trace of pain in a second or so consciousness returned i saw myself in the presence of the audience and apparatus and by the help of these external appearances immediately concluded that i had received the battery discharge the intellectual consciousness of my position was restored with exceeding rapidity but not so the optical consciousness to prevent the audience from being alarmed i observed that it had often been my desire to receive accidentally such a shock and that my wish had at length been fulfilled but while making this remark the appearance which my body presented to myself was that of a number of separate pieces the arms for example were detached from the trunk and seemed suspended in the air in fact memory and the power of reasoning appeared to be complete long before the optic nerve was restored to22 healthy action but what i wish chiefly to dwell upon here is the absolute painlessness of the shock and there cannot be a doubt that to a person struck dead by lightning the passage from life to death occurs without consciousness being in the least degree implicated it is an abrupt stoppage of sensation unaccompanied by a pang ',\n",
       " 'occasionally branched markings are found on the bodies of those struck by lightning and these are often taken to be photographic impressions of trees under which the persons may have been standing at the time of the flash the markings however are nothing of the kind but are merely physiological effects due to the passage of the discharge ',\n",
       " 'during a thunderstorm it is safer to be in the house than out in the open it is probable that draughts are a source of some danger and the windows and doors of the room ought to be shut animals are more liable to be struck by lightning than men and a shed containing horses or cows is a dangerous place in which to take shelter in fact it is better to remain in the open if one is caught in a storm while out of reach of a house or other building free from draughts and containing no animals the safest plan is to lie down not minding the rain umbrellas are distinctly dangerous and never should be used during a storm wire fences hedges and still or running water should be given a wide berth and it is safer to be alone than in company with a crowd of people it is extremely foolish to take shelter under an isolated tree for such trees are very liable to be struck isolated beech trees appear to have considerable immunity from lightning but any tree standing alone should be avoided the oak being particularly dangerous on the other hand a fairly thick wood is comparatively safe and failing a house should be chosen before all other places of refuge 23 horses are liable to be struck and if a storm comes on while one is out driving it is safer to keep quite clear of the animals ',\n",
       " 'when a wimshurst machine has been in action for a little time a peculiar odour is noticed this is due to the formation of a modified and chemically more active form of oxygen called ozone the name being derived from the greek ozein to smell ozone has very invigorating effects when breathed and it is also a powerful germicide capable of killing the germs which give rise to contagious diseases during a thunderstorm ozone is produced in large quantities by the electric discharges and thus the air receives as it were a new lease of life and we feel the refreshing effects when the storm is over we shall speak again of ozone in chapter xxv ',\n",
       " 'thunder probably is caused by the heating and sudden expansion of the air in the path of the discharge which creates a partial vacuum into which the surrounding air rushes violently light travels at the rate of 186 000 miles per second and therefore the flash reaches us practically instantaneously but sound travels at the rate of only about 1115 feet per second so that the thunder takes an appreciable time to reach us and the farther away the discharge the greater the interval between the flash and the thunder thus by multiplying the number of seconds which elapse between the flash and the thunder by 1115 we may calculate roughly the distance in feet of the discharge a lightning flash may be several miles in length the greatest recorded length being about ten miles the sounds produced at different points along its path reach us at different times producing the familiar sharp rattle and the following rolling and rumbling is produced by the echoes from other clouds the noise of a thunder clap is so tremendous that it seems as though the sound24 would be heard far and wide but the greatest distance at which thunder has been heard is about fifteen miles in this respect it is interesting to compare the loudest thunder clap we ever heard with the noise of the famous eruption of krakatoa in 1883 which was heard at the enormous distance of nearly three thousand miles ',\n",
       " 'when franklin had demonstrated the nature of lightning he began to consider the possibility of protecting buildings from the disastrous effects of the lightning stroke at that time the amount of damage caused by lightning was very great cathedrals churches public buildings and in fact all tall edifices were in danger every time a severe thunderstorm took place in their neighbourhood for there was absolutely nothing to prevent their destruction if the lightning chanced to strike them ships at sea too were damaged very frequently by lightning and often some of the crew were killed or disabled to day thanks to the lightning conductor it is an unusual occurrence for ships or large buildings to be damaged by lightning the lightning strikes them as before but in the great majority of cases it is led away harmlessly to earth ',\n",
       " 'franklin was the first to suggest the possibility of protecting buildings by means of a rod of some conducting material terminating in a point at the highest part of the building and leading down outside the building into the earth lightning conductors at the present day are similar to franklin s rod but many improvements have been made from time to time as our knowledge of the nature and action of the lightning discharge has increased a modern lightning conductor generally consists of one or more pointed rods fixed to the highest parts of the building and connected to a cable running directly to earth this cable is kept as straight as possible because turns and bends offer a very high resistance to the rapidly oscillating25 discharge and it is connected to large copper plates buried in permanently moist ground or in water or to water or gas mains copper is generally used for the cable but iron also may be employed in any case the cable must be of sufficient thickness to prevent the possibility of its being deflagrated by the discharge in ships the arrangements are similar except that the cable is connected to the copper sheathing of the bottom ',\n",
       " 'the fixing of lightning conductors must be carried out with great care for an improperly fixed conductor is not only useless but may be a source of actual danger lightning flashes vary greatly in character and while a carefully erected lightning conductor is capable of dealing with most of them there are unfortunately certain kinds of discharge with which it now and then is unable to deal the only absolutely certain way of protecting a building is to surround it completely by a sort of cage of metal but except for buildings in which explosives are stored this plan is usually impracticable ',\n",
       " 'the electricity of the atmosphere manifests itself in other forms beside the lightning the most remarkable of these manifestations is the beautiful phenomenon known in the northern hemisphere as the aurora borealis and in the southern hemisphere as the aurora australis aurora means the morning hour or dawn and the phenomenon is so called from its resemblance to the dawn of day the aurora is seen in its full glory only in high latitudes and it is quite unknown at the equator it assumes various forms sometimes appearing as an arch of light with rapidly moving streamers of different colours and sometimes taking the form of a luminous curtain extending across the sky the light of the aurora is never very strong and as a rule stars can be seen through it auroras are sometimes accompanied by rustling or crackling26 sounds but the sounds are always extremely faint some authorities assert that these sounds do not exist and that they are the result of imagination but other equally reliable observers have heard the sounds quite plainly on several occasions probably the explanation of this confliction of evidence is that the great majority of auroras are silent so that an observer might witness many of them without hearing any sounds the height at which auroras occur is a disputed point and one which it is difficult to determine accurately but most observers agree that it is generally from 60 to 125 miles above the earth s surface ',\n",
       " 'there is little doubt that the aurora is caused by the passage of electric discharges through the higher regions of the atmosphere where the air is so rarefied as to act as a partial conductor and its effects can be imitated in some degree by passing powerful discharges through tubes from which the air has been exhausted to a partial vacuum auroral displays are usually accompanied by magnetic disturbances which sometimes completely upset telegraphic communication auroras and magnetic storms appear to be connected in some way with solar disturbances for they are frequently simultaneous with an unusual number of sunspots and all three run in cycles of about eleven and a half years ',\n",
       " 'in the previous chapters we have dealt with electricity in charged bodies or static electricity and now we must turn to electricity in motion or current electricity in chapter i we saw that if a metal rod is held in the hand and rubbed electricity is produced but it immediately escapes along the rod to the hand and so to the earth in other words the electricity flows away along the conducting path provided by the rod and the hand when we see the word flow we at once think of a fluid of some kind and we often hear people speak of the electric fluid now whatever electricity may be it certainly is not a fluid and we use the word flow in connexion with electricity simply because it is the most convenient word we can find for the purpose just in the same way we might say that when we hold a poker with its point in the fire heat flows along it towards our hand although we know quite well that heat is not a fluid in the experiment with the metal rod referred to above the electricity flows away instantly leaving the rod unelectrified but if we arrange matters so that the electricity is renewed as fast as it flows away then we get a continuous flow or current ',\n",
       " 'somewhere about the year 1780 an italian anatomist luigi galvani was studying the effects of electricity upon animal organisms using for the purpose the legs of freshly killed frogs in the course of his experiments he happened to hang against an iron window rail a bundle of frogs legs28 fastened together with a piece of copper wire and he noticed that the legs began to twitch in a peculiar manner he knew that a frog s leg would twitch when electricity was applied to it and he concluded that the twitchings in this case were caused in the same way so far he was quite right but then came the problem of how any electricity could be produced in these circumstances and here he went astray it never occurred to him that the source of the electricity might be found in something quite apart from the legs and so he came to the conclusion that the phenomenon was due to electricity produced in some mysterious way in the tissues of the animal itself he therefore announced that he had discovered the existence of a kind of animal electricity and it was left for his fellow countryman alessandro volta to prove that the twitchings were due to electricity produced by the contact of the two metals the iron of the window rail and the copper wire ',\n",
       " 'volta found that when two different metals were placed in contact in air one became positively charged and the other negatively these charges however were extremely feeble and in his endeavours to obtain stronger results he hit upon the idea of using a number of pairs of metals and he constructed the apparatus known as the voltaic pile fig 6 29 this consists of a number of pairs of zinc and copper discs each pair being separated from the next pair by a disc of cloth moistened with salt water these are piled up and placed in a frame as shown in the figure one end of the pile thus terminates in a zinc disc and the other in a copper disc and as soon as the two are connected by a wire or other conductor a continuous current of electricity is produced the cause of the electricity produced by the voltaic pile was the subject of a long and heated controversy there were two main theories that of volta himself which attributed the electricity to the mere contact of unlike metals and the chemical theory which ascribed it to chemical action the chemical theory is now generally accepted but certain points into which we need not enter are still in dispute ',\n",
       " 'there is a curious experiment which some of my readers may like to try place a copper coin on a sheet of zinc and set an ordinary garden snail to crawl across the zinc towards the coin as soon as the snail comes in contact with the copper it shrinks back and shows every sign of having received a shock one can well imagine that an enthusiastic gardener pestered with snails would watch this experiment with great glee ',\n",
       " 'volta soon found that it was not necessary to have his pairs of metals in actual metallic contact and that better results were got by placing them in a vessel filled with dilute acid fig 7 is a diagram of a simple voltaic cell of30 this kind and it shows the direction of the current when the zinc and the copper are connected by the wire in order to get some idea of the reason why a current flows we must understand the meaning of electric potential if water is poured into a vessel a certain water pressure is produced the amount of this pressure depends upon the level of the water and this in turn depends upon the quantity of water and the capacity of the vessel for a given quantity of water will reach a higher level in a small vessel than in a larger one in the same way if electricity is imparted to a conductor an electric pressure is produced its amount depending upon the quantity of electricity and the electric capacity of the conductor for conductors vary in capacity just as water vessels do ',\n",
       " 'this electric pressure is called potential and electricity tends to flow from a conductor of higher to one of lower potential when we say that a place is so many feet above or below sea level we are using the level of the sea as a zero level and in estimating electric potential we take the potential of the earth s surface as zero and we regard a positively electrified body as one at a positive or relatively high potential and a negatively electrified body as one at a negative or relatively low potential this may be clearer if we think of temperature and the thermometer temperatures above zero are positive and represented by the sign and those below zero are negative and represented by the sign thus we assume that an electric current flows from a positive to a negative conductor ',\n",
       " 'in a voltaic cell the plates are at different potentials so that when they are connected by a wire a current flows and we say that the current leaves the cell at the positive terminal and enters it again at the negative terminal as shown in fig 7 the current moves in opposite directions inside and outside the cell making a complete round called a circuit and if the circuit is broken anywhere the current ceases to flow if the circuit is complete the current keeps on flowing trying to equalize the electric pressure or potential but it is unable to do this because the chemical action between the acid and the zinc maintains the difference of potential between the plates this chemical action results in wasting of the zinc and weakening of the acid and as long as it continues the current keeps on flowing when we wish to stop the current we break the circuit by disconnecting the wire joining the terminals and the cell then should be at rest but owing to the impurities in ordinary commercial zinc chemical action still continues in order to prevent wasting when the current is not required the surface of the zinc is coated with a thin film of mercury the zinc is then said to be amalgamated and it is not acted upon by the acid so long as the circuit remains broken ',\n",
       " 'the current from a simple voltaic cell does not remain at a constant strength but after a short time it begins to weaken rapidly the cell is then said to be polarized and this polarization is caused by bubbles of hydrogen gas which accumulate on the surface of the copper plate during the chemical action these bubbles of gas weaken the current partly by resisting its flow for they are bad conductors and still more by trying to set up another current in the opposite direction for this reason the simple voltaic cell is unsuitable for long spells of work and many cells have been devised to avoid the polarization trouble one of the most successful of these is the daniell cell it consists of an outer vessel of copper which serves as the copper plate and an inner porous pot containing a zinc rod dilute sulphuric acid is put into the porous pot and a strong solution of copper sulphate into the outer jar when the circuit is closed the hydrogen liberated by the32 action of the zinc on the acid passes through the porous pot and splits up the copper sulphate into copper and sulphuric acid in this way pure copper instead of hydrogen is deposited on the copper plate no polarization takes place and the current is constant ',\n",
       " 'other cells have different combinations of metals such as silver zinc or platinum zinc and carbon is also largely used in place of one metal as in the familiar carbon zinc leclanch cell used for ringing electric bells this cell consists of an inner porous pot containing a carbon plate packed round with a mixture of crushed carbon and manganese dioxide and an outer glass jar containing a zinc rod and a solution of sal ammoniac polarization is checked by the oxygen in the manganese dioxide which seizes the hydrogen on its way to the carbon plate and combines with it if the cell is used continuously however this action cannot keep pace with the rate at which the hydrogen is produced and so the cell becomes polarized but it soon recovers after a short rest ',\n",
       " 'the so called dry cells so much used at the present time are not really dry at all if they were they would give no current they are in fact leclanch cells in which the containing vessel is made of zinc to take the place of a zinc rod and they are dry only in the sense that the liquid is taken up by an absorbent material so as to form a moist paste dry cells are placed inside closely fitting cardboard tubes and are sealed up at the top their chief advantage lies in their portability for as there is no free liquid to spill they can be carried about and placed in any position ',\n",
       " 'we have seen that the continuance of the current from a voltaic cell depends upon the keeping up of a difference of potential between the plates the force which serves to maintain this difference is called the electro motive force and it is measured in volts the actual flow of electricity33 is measured in amperes probably all my readers are familiar with the terms volt and ampere but perhaps some may not be quite clear about the distinction between the two when water flows along a pipe we know that it is being forced to do so by pressure resulting from a difference of level that is to say a difference of level produces a water moving or water motive force and in a similar way a difference of potential produces an electricity moving or electro motive force which is measured in volts if we wish to describe the rate of flow of water we state it in gallons per second and the rate of flow of electricity is stated in amperes volts thus represent the pressure at which a current is supplied while the current itself is measured in amperes ',\n",
       " 'we may take this opportunity of speaking of electric resistance a current of water flowing through a pipe is resisted by friction against the inner surface of the pipe and a current of electricity flowing through a circuit also meets with a resistance though this is not due to friction in a good conductor this resistance is small but in a bad conductor or non conductor it is very great the resistance also depends upon length and area of cross section so that a long wire offers more resistance than a short one and a thin wire more than a thick one before any current can flow in a circuit the electro motive force must overcome the resistance and we might say that the volts drive the amperes through the resistance the unit of resistance is the ohm and the definition of a volt is that electro motive force which will cause a current of one ampere to flow through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm these units of measurement are named after three famous scientists volta amp re and ohm ',\n",
       " 'a number of cells coupled together form a battery and different methods of coupling are used to get different34 results in addition to the resistance of the circuit outside the cell the cell itself offers an internal resistance and part of the electro motive force is used up in overcoming this resistance if we can decrease this internal resistance we shall have a larger current at our disposal and one way of doing this is to increase the size of the plates this of course means making the cell larger and very large cells take up a lot of room and are troublesome to move about we can get the same effect however by coupling if we connect together all the positive terminals and all the negative terminals of several cells that is copper to copper and zinc to zinc in daniell cells we get the same result as if we had one very large cell the current is much larger but the electro motive force remains the same as if only one cell were used or in other words we have more amperes but no more volts this is called connecting in parallel and the method is shown in fig 8 on the other hand if as is usually the case we want a larger electro motive force we connect the positive terminal of one cell to the negative terminal of the next or copper to zinc all through in this way we add together the electro motive forces of all the cells but the amount of current remains that of a single cell that is we get more volts but no more amperes this is called connecting in series and the arrangement is shown35 in fig 9 we can also increase both volts and amperes by combining the two methods ',\n",
       " 'a voltaic cell gives us a considerable quantity of electricity at low pressure the electro motive force of a leclanch cell being about 1 volts and that of a daniell cell about 1 volt we may perhaps get some idea of the electrical conditions existing during a thunderstorm from the fact that to produce a spark one mile long through air at ordinary pressure we should require a battery of more than a thousand million daniell cells cells such as we have described in this chapter are called primary cells as distinguished from accumulators which are called secondary cells some of the practical applications of primary cells will be described in later chapters ',\n",
       " 'besides the voltaic cell in which the current is produced by chemical action there is the thermo electric battery or thermopile which produces current directly from heat energy about 1822 seebeck was experimenting with voltaic pairs of metals and he found that a current could be produced in a complete metallic circuit consisting of different metals joined together by keeping these joinings at different temperatures fig 10 shows a simple arrangement for demonstrating this effect which is known as the36 seebeck effect a slab of bismuth bb has placed upon it a bent strip of copper c if one of the junctions of the two metals is heated as shown a current flows and the same effect is produced by cooling one of the junctions this current continues to flow as long as the two junctions are kept at different temperatures in 1834 another scientist peltier discovered that if a current was passed across a junction of two different metals this junction was either heated or cooled according to the direction in which the current flowed in fig 10 the current across the heated junction tends to cool the junction while the bunsen burner opposes this cooling and keeps up the temperature a certain amount of the heat energy is thus transformed into electrical energy at the other junction the current produces a heating effect so that some of the electrical energy is retransformed into heat ',\n",
       " 'a thermopile consists of a number of alternate bars or strips of two unlike metals joined together as shown diagrammatically in fig 11 the arrangement is such that the odd junctions are at one side and the even ones37 at the other the odd junctions are heated and the even ones cooled and a current flows when the circuit is completed by using a larger number of junctions and by increasing the difference of temperature between them the voltage of the current may be increased thermopiles are nothing like so efficient as voltaic cells and they are more costly they are used to a limited extent for purposes requiring a very small and constant current but for generating considerable quantities of current at high pressure they are quite useless the only really important practical use of the thermopile is in the detection and measurement of very minute differences of temperature which are beyond the capabilities of the ordinary thermometer within certain limits the electro motive force of a thermopile is exactly proportionate to the difference of temperature the very slightest difference of temperature produces a current and by connecting the wires from a specially constructed thermopile to a delicate instrument for measuring the strength of the current temperature differences of less than one millionth of a degree can be detected ',\n",
       " 'if we had two large water tanks one of which could be emptied only by allowing the bottom to fall completely out and the other by means of a narrow pipe it is easy to see which would be the more useful to us as a source of water supply if both tanks were filled then from the first we could get only a sudden uncontrollable rush of water but from the other we could get a steady stream extending over a long period and easily controlled the leyden jar stores electricity but in yielding up its store it acts like the first tank giving a sudden discharge in the form of a bright spark we cannot control the discharge and therefore we cannot make it do useful work for us for practical purposes we require a storing arrangement that will act like the second tank giving us a steady current of electricity for a long period and this we have in the accumulator or storage cell ',\n",
       " 'a current of electricity has the power of decomposing certain liquids if we pass a current through water the water is split up into its two constituent gases hydrogen and oxygen and this may be shown by the apparatus seen in fig 12 it consists of a glass vessel with two strips of platinum to which the current is led the vessel contains water to which has been added a little sulphuric acid to increase its conducting power and over the strips are inverted two test tubes filled with the acidulated water the39 platinum strips which are called electrodes are connected to a battery of daniell cells when the current passes the water is decomposed and oxygen collects at the electrode connected to the positive terminal of the battery and hydrogen at the other electrode the two gases rise up into the test tubes and displace the water in them and the whole process is called the electrolysis of water if now we disconnect the battery and join the two electrodes by a wire we find that a current flows from the apparatus as from a voltaic cell but in the opposite direction from the original battery current ',\n",
       " 'it will be remembered that one of the troubles with a simple voltaic cell was polarization caused by the accumulation of hydrogen and that this weakened the current by setting up an opposing electro motive force tending to produce another current in the opposite direction in the present case a similar opposing or back electro motive force is produced and as soon as the battery current is stopped and the electrodes are connected we get a current in the reverse direction and this current continues to flow until the two gases have recombined and the electrodes have regained their original condition consequently we can see that in order to electrolyze water our battery must have an electro motive force greater than that set up in opposition to it and at least two daniell cells are required ',\n",
       " '40',\n",
       " 'this apparatus thus may be made to serve to some extent as an accumulator or storage cell and it also serves to show that an accumulator does not store up or accumulate electricity in a voltaic cell we have chemical energy converted into electrical energy and here we have first electrical energy converted into chemical energy and then the chemical energy converted back again into electrical energy this is a rough and ready way of putting the matter but it is good enough for practical purposes and at any rate it makes it quite clear that what an accumulator really stores up is not electricity but energy which is given out in the form of electricity ',\n",
       " 'the apparatus just described is of little use as a source of current and the first really practical accumulator was made in 1878 by gaston plant the electrodes were two strips of sheet lead placed one upon the other but separated by some insulating material and made into a roll this roll was placed in dilute sulphuric acid and one strip or plate connected to the positive and the other to the negative terminal of the source of current the current was passed for a certain length of time and then the accumulator partly discharged after which current was passed again but in the reverse direction followed by another period of discharge this process which is called forming was continued for several days and its effect was to change one plate into a spongy condition and to form a coating of peroxide of lead on the other when the plates were properly formed the accumulator was ready to be fully charged and put into use the effect of charging was to rob one plate of its oxygen and to transfer this oxygen to the other plate which thus received an overcharge of the gas during the discharge of the accumulator the excess of oxygen went back to the place from which it had been taken and the current continued until the surfaces of both41 plates were reduced to a chemically inactive state the accumulator could be charged and discharged over and over again as long as the plates remained in good order ',\n",
       " 'in 1881 faure hit upon the idea of coating the plates with a paste of red lead and this greatly shortened the time of forming at first it was found difficult to make the paste stick to the plates but this trouble was got rid of by making the plates in the form of grids and pressing the paste into the perforations many further improvements have been made from time to time but instead of tracing these we will go on at once to the description of a present day accumulator there are now many excellent accumulators made but we have not space to consider more than one and we will select that known as the chloride accumulator ',\n",
       " 'the positive plate of this accumulator is of the plant type but it is not simply a casting of pure lead but is made by a building up process which allows of the use of a lead antimony mixture for the grids this gives greater strength and the grids themselves are unaffected by the chemical changes which take place during the charging and discharging of the cell the active material that is the material which undergoes chemical change is pure lead tape coiled up into rosettes which are so designed that the acid can circulate through the plates these rosettes are driven into the perforations of the grid by a hydraulic press and during the process of forming they expand and thus become very firmly fixed the negative plate has a frame made in two parts which are riveted together after the insertion of the active material which is thus contained in a number of small cages the plate is covered outside with a finely perforated sheet of lead which prevents the active material from falling out it is of the utmost importance that the positive and negative plates should be42 kept apart when in the cell and in the chloride accumulator this is ensured by the use of a patent separator made of a thin sheet of wood the size of the plates before being used the wood undergoes a special treatment to remove all substances which might be harmful and it then remains unchanged either in appearance or composition other insulating substances such as glass rods or ebonite forks can be used as separators but it is claimed that the wood separator is not only more satisfactory but that in some unexplained way it actually helps to keep up the capacity of the cell the plates are placed in glass or lead lined wood or metal boxes and are suspended from above the dilute sulphuric acid with which the cells are filled a space is left below the plates for the sediment which accumulates during the working of the cell ',\n",
       " 'in all but the smallest cells several pairs of plates are used all the positive plates being connected together and all the negative plates this gives the same effect as two very large plates on the principle of connecting in parallel spoken of in chapter iv a single cell of whatever size gives current at about two volts and to get higher voltages many cells are connected in series as with primary cells the capacity is generally measured in ampere hours for instance an accumulator that will give a current of eight amperes for one hour or of four amperes for two hours or one ampere for eight hours is said to have a capacity of eight ampere hours ',\n",
       " 'accumulators are usually charged from a dynamo or from the public mains and the electro motive force of the charging current must be not less than 2 volts for each cell in order to overcome the back electro motive force of the cells themselves it is possible to charge accumulators from primary cells but except on a very small scale the process is comparatively expensive non polarizing43 cells such as the daniell must be used for this purpose ',\n",
       " 'the practical applications of accumulators are almost innumerable and year by year they increase as the most important of these are connected with the use of electricity for power and light it will be more convenient to speak of them in the chapters dealing with this subject minor uses of accumulators will be referred to briefly from time to time in other chapters ',\n",

       " 'the coil through which we send the battery current is called the primary coil and the one in which a current is induced is called the secondary coil the two momentary currents in the secondary coil do not both flow in the same direction the current induced on making the circuit flows in a direction opposite to that of the current in the primary coil and the current induced on breaking the circuit flows in the same direction as that in the primary coil if the two coils are exactly alike the induced current will have the same voltage as the primary current but if the secondary coil has twice as many turns of wire as the primary coil the induced current will have twice the voltage of the primary current in this way by multiplying the turns of wire in the secondary coil we can go on increasing the voltage of the induced current and this is the principle upon which the induction coil works ',\n",
       " 'we may now describe the construction of such a coil the primary coil is made of a few turns of thick copper wire carefully insulated and inside it is placed a core consisting of a bundle of separate wires of soft iron upon this coil but carefully insulated from it is wound the secondary coil consisting of a great number of turns of very fine wire in large induction coils the secondary coil has thousands of times as many turns as the primary and the wire forming it may be more than a hundred miles in length the ends of the secondary coil are brought to terminals so that they can be connected up to any apparatus as desired ',\n",
       " 'in order that the induced currents shall follow each other in quick succession some means of rapidly making63 and breaking the circuit is required and this is provided by an automatic contact breaker it consists of a small piece of soft iron a fig 17 fixed to a spring b having a platinum tip at c the adjustable screw d also has a platinum tip e normally the two platinum tips are just touching one another and matters are arranged so that their contact completes the circuit when the apparatus is connected to a suitable battery a current flows through the primary coil and the iron core f becomes an electro magnet which draws a towards it the platinum tips are thus no longer in contact and the circuit is broken immediately this occurs the iron core loses its magnetism and ceases to attract a which is then moved back again by the spring b so that the platinum tips touch the circuit is once more completed and the process begins over again all this takes place with the utmost rapidity and the speed at which the contact breaker works is so great as to produce a musical note there are many other types of contact breakers but in every case the purpose is the same namely to make and break the primary circuit as rapidly as possible ',\n",
       " 'the efficiency of the coil is greatly increased by a condenser which is inserted in the primary circuit it consists of alternate layers of tinfoil and paraffined paper and its action is like that of a leyden jar a switch is provided to turn the battery current on or off and there is also a reversing switch or commutator by means of which the direction of the current may be64 reversed the whole arrangement is mounted on a suitable wooden base and its general appearance is shown in fig 18 ',\n",
       " 'by means of a large induction coil we can obtain a voltage hundreds or even thousands of times greater than that of the original battery current but on account of the great resistance of a very long thin wire the amperage is much smaller the induction coil produces a rapid succession of sparks similar to those obtained from a wimshurst machine a coil has been constructed capable of giving sparks 42 inches in length and having a secondary coil with 340 000 turns of wire the total length of the wire being 280 miles induction coils are largely employed for scientific purposes and they are used in wireless telegraphy and in the production of x rays ',\n",
       " 'the principle of the induction coil can be applied also to the lowering of the voltage of a current if we make the secondary coil with less instead of more turns of wire than the primary coil the induced current will be of lower voltage than the primary current but65 its amperage will be correspondingly higher this fact is taken advantage of in cases where it is desirable to transform a high voltage current from the public mains down to a lower voltage current of greater amperage ',\n",
       " 'most of my readers will have seen the small working models of electric tramcars which can be bought at any electrical supply stores these usually require a current of about one ampere at three or four volts if we connect such a car to the battery recommended for it and keep it running continuously we find that the battery soon begins to show signs of exhaustion now if we imagine our little car increased to the size of an electric street car and further imagine say a hundred such cars carrying heavy loads day after day from morning to night we shall realize that a battery of cells capable of supplying the current necessary to run these cars would be so colossal as to be utterly impracticable we therefore must look beyond the voltaic cell for a source of current for such a purpose and this source we find in a machine called the dynamo from the greek word dynamis meaning force ',\n",
       " 'oersted s discovery of the production of magnetism by electricity naturally suggested the possibility of producing electricity from magnetism in the year 1831 one of the most brilliant of our british scientists michael faraday discovered that a current of electricity could be induced in a coil of wire either by moving the coil towards or away from a magnet or by moving a magnet towards or away from the coil this may be shown in a simple way by connecting the ends of a coil of insulated wire to a galvanometer 67 and moving a bar magnet in and out of the coil when the galvanometer shows that a current is induced in the coil on the insertion of the magnet and again on its withdrawal we have seen that a magnet is surrounded by a field of magnetic force and faraday found that the current was induced when the lines of force were cut across ',\n",
       " 'utilizing this discovery faraday constructed the first dynamo which consisted of a copper plate or disc rotated between the poles of a powerful horse shoe magnet so as to cut the lines of force the current flowed either from the shaft to the rim or vice versa according to the direction of rotation and it was conducted away by means of two wires with spring contacts one pressing against the shaft and the other against the circumference of the disc this machine was miserably inefficient but it was the very first dynamo and from it have been slowly evolved the mighty dynamos used to day in electric power stations throughout the world there is a little story told of faraday which is worth repeating even if it is not true speaking of his discovery that a magnet could be made to produce an electric current a lady once said to him this is all very interesting but what is the use of it madam replied faraday what is the use of a baby in faraday s baby dynamo as in all others some kind of power must be used to produce the necessary motion so that all dynamos are really machines for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy ',\n",
       " 'the copper disc in this first dynamo did not prove satisfactory and faraday soon substituted for it rotating coils of wire in 1832 a dynamo was constructed in which a length of insulated wire was wound upon two bobbins having soft iron cores and a powerful horse shoe magnet was fixed to a rotating spindle in such a position that its poles faced the cores of the bobbins this machine gave68 a fair current but it was found that the magnet gradually lost its magnetism on account of the vibration caused by its rotation the next step was to make the magnet a fixture and to rotate the bobbins of wire this was a great improvement and the power of machines built on this principle was much increased by having a number of rotating coils and several magnets one such machine had 64 separate coils rotating between the poles of 40 large magnets finally permanent magnets were superseded by electro magnets which gave a much more powerful field of force ',\n",
       " 'having seen something of the underlying principle and of the history of the dynamo we must turn our attention to its actual working fig 19 is a rough representation of a dynamo in its simplest form the two poles of the magnet are shown marked north and south and between them revolves the coil of wire a a mounted on a spindle ss this revolving coil is called the armature to each of the insulated rings rr is fixed one end of the coil and bb are two brushes of copper or carbon one pressing on each ring from these brushes the current is69 led away into the main circuit and in this case we may suppose that the current is used to light a lamp ',\n",
       " 'in speaking of the induction coil we saw that the currents induced on making and on breaking the circuit flowed in opposite directions and similarly faraday found that the currents induced in a coil of wire on inserting and on withdrawing his magnet flowed in opposite directions in the present case the magnet is stationary and the coil moves but the effect is just the same now if we suppose the armature to be revolving in a clockwise direction then a is descending and entering the magnetic field in front of the north pole consequently a current is induced in the coil and of course in the main circuit also in one direction continuing its course a passes away from this portion of the magnetic field and thus a current is induced in the opposite direction in this way we get a current which reverses its direction every half revolution and such a current is called an alternating current if as in our diagram there are only two magnetic poles the current flows backwards and forwards once every revolution but by using a number of magnets arranged so that the coil passes in turn the poles of each it can be made to flow backwards and forwards several times one complete flow backwards and forwards is called a period and the number of periods per second is called the periodicity or frequency of the current a dynamo with one coil or set of coils gives what is called single phase current that is a current having one wave which keeps flowing backwards and forwards if there are two distinct sets of coils we get a two phase current in which there are two separate waves one rising as the other falls similarly by using more sets of coils we may obtain three phase or polyphase currents ',\n",
       " 'alternating current is unsuitable for certain purposes 70 such as electroplating and by making a small alteration in our dynamo we get a continuous or direct current which does not reverse its direction fig 20 shows the new arrangement instead of the two rings in fig 19 we have now a single ring divided into two parts each half being connected to one end of the revolving coil each brush therefore remains on one portion of the ring for half a revolution and then passes over on to the other portion during one half revolution we will suppose the current to be flowing from brush b in the direction of the lamp then during the next half revolution the current flows in the opposite direction but brush b has passed on to the other half of the ring and so the current is still leaving by it in this way the current must always flow in the same direction in the main circuit leaving by brush b and returning by brush b this arrangement for making the alternating current into a continuous current is called a commutator ',\n",
       " 'in actual practice a dynamo has a set of electro magnets and the armature consists of many coils of wire mounted on a core of iron which has the effect of concentrating the lines of force the armature generally revolves in small dynamos but in large ones it is usually a fixture while the electro magnets revolve plate iv shows a typical dynamo and its parts ',\n",
       " 'as we saw in an earlier chapter an electro magnet has magnetic powers only while a current is being passed through its winding and so some means of supplying current to the electro magnets in a dynamo must be provided it is a remarkable fact that it is almost impossible to obtain a piece of iron which has not some traces of magnetism and so when a dynamo is first set up there is often sufficient magnetism in the iron of the electro magnets to produce a very weak field the rapid cutting of the feeble lines of force of this field sets up a weak current which acting upon the electro magnets gradually brings them up to full strength once the dynamo is generating current it keeps on feeding its magnets by sending either the whole or a part of its current through them after it has once been set going the dynamo is always able to start again because the magnet cores retain enough magnetism to set up a weak field if there is not enough magnetism in the cores to start a dynamo for the first time a current from some outside source is sent round the magnets ',\n",
       " 'the foregoing remarks apply to continuous current dynamos only alternating current can be used for exciting electro magnets but in this case the magnetic field produced is alternating also so that each pole of the magnet has north and south magnetism alternately this will not do for dynamo field magnets and therefore an alternating current dynamo cannot feed its own magnets the electro magnets in such dynamos are supplied with current from a72 separate continuous current dynamo which may be of quite small size ',\n",
       " 'it is a very interesting fact that electric current can be generated by a dynamo in which the earth itself is used to provide the magnetic field no permanent or electro magnets being used at all a simple form of dynamo of this kind consists of a rectangular loop of copper wire rotating about an axis pointing east and west so that the loop cuts the lines of force of the earth s magnetic field ',\n",
       " 'the dynamo provides us with a constant supply of electric current but this current is no use unless we can make it do work for us if we reverse the usual order of things in regard to a dynamo and supply the machine with current instead of mechanical power we find that the armature begins to revolve rapidly and the machine is no longer a dynamo but has become an electric motor this shows us that an electric motor is simply a dynamo reversed let us suppose that we wish to use the dynamo in fig 20 as a motor in order to supply the current we will take away the lamp and substitute a second continuous current dynamo we know from chapter vii that when a current is sent through a coil of wire the coil becomes a magnet with a north and a south pole the coil in our dynamo becomes a magnet as soon as the current is switched on and the attraction between its poles and the opposite poles of the magnet causes it to make half a revolution at this point the commutator reverses the current and consequently the polarity of the coil so that there is now repulsion where previously there was attraction and the coil makes another half revolution so the process goes on until the armature attains a very high speed in general construction there is practically no difference between a dynamo and a motor 73 but there are differences in detail which adapt each to its own particular work by making certain alterations in their construction electric motors can be run with alternating current ',\n",
       " 'the fact that a dynamo could be reversed and run as a motor was known probably as early as 1838 but the great value of this reversibility does not seem to have been realized until 1873 at an industrial exhibition held at vienna in that year it so happened that a workman or machinery attendant connected two cables to a dynamo which was standing idle and he was much surprised to find that it at once began to revolve at a great speed it was then seen that the cables led to another dynamo which was running and that the current from this source had made the first dynamo into a motor there are many versions of this story but the important point in all is that this was the first occasion on which general attention was drawn to the possibilities of the electric motor ',\n",
       " 'the practical advantages afforded by the electric motor are many and great once we have installed a sufficiently powerful dynamo and a steam or other engine to drive it we can place motors just where they are required either close to the dynamo or miles away driving them simply by means of a connecting cable in factories motors can be placed close to the machines they are required to drive anywhere in the building thus doing away with all complicated and dangerous systems of shafting and belts in many cases where it would be either utterly impossible or at least extremely inconvenient to use any form of steam gas or oil engine electric motors can be employed without the slightest difficulty in order to realize this one only has to think of the positions in which electrically driven ventilating fans are placed or of the unpleasantly familiar74 electric drill of the dentist an electric motor is small and compact gives off no fumes and practically no heat makes very little noise is capable of running for very long periods at high speed and with the utmost steadiness and requires extremely little attention ',\n",
       " 'it is apparently a very simple matter to fit up a power station with a number of very large dynamos driven by powerful engines and to distribute the current produced by these dynamos to all parts of a town or district by means of cables but as a matter of fact it is a fairly complicated engineering problem first of all the source of power for driving the dynamos has to be considered in private and other small power plants gas petrol or oil engines are generally used but for large stations the choice lies between steam and water power in this country steam power is used almost exclusively formerly the ordinary reciprocating steam engines were always employed and though these are still in very extensive use they are being superseded in many cases by steam turbines the turbine is capable of running at higher speeds than the reciprocating engine and at the greatest speeds it runs with a great deal less noise and with practically no vibration at all more than this turbines take up much less room and require less oil and attendance the turbines are coupled directly to the dynamos so that the two machines appear almost as one in the power station shown on plate v a number of alternating current dynamos coupled to steam turbines are seen ',\n",
       " 'a large power station consumes enormous quantities of coal and for convenience of supply it is situated on the bank of a river or canal or if neither of these is available 76 as close to the railway as possible the unloading of the coal barges or trucks is done mechanically the coal passing into a large receiving hopper from here it is taken to another hopper close to the furnaces by means of coal elevators and conveyors which consist of a number of buckets fixed at short intervals on an endless travelling chain from the furnace hopper the coal is fed into the furnaces by mechanical stokers and the resulting ash and clinker falls into a pit below the furnaces from which it is carted away ',\n",
       " 'the heat produced in the furnaces is used to generate steam and from the boilers the steam passes to the engines along a steam pipe after doing its work in the engines the steam generally passes to a condenser in which it is cooled to water freed from oil and grease and returned to the boilers to be transformed once more into steam as this water from the condenser is quite warm less heat is required to raise steam from it than would be the case if the boiler supply were kept up with cold water the power generated by the engines is used to drive the dynamos and stout copper cables convey the current from these to what are called bus bars there are two of these one receiving the positive cable from the dynamos and the other the negative cable and the bars run from end to end of a large main switchboard from this switchboard the current is distributed by other cables known as feeders ',\n",
       " 'the nature of the current generated at a power station is determined to a great extent by the size of the district to be supplied generally speaking where the current is not to be transmitted beyond a radius of about two miles from the station continuous current is generated while alternating current is employed for the supply of larger areas in some cases both kinds of current are generated at one station ',\n",
       " 'if continuous current is to be used it is generated usually at a pressure of from 400 to 500 volts the average being about 440 volts and the supply is generally on what is known as the three wire system three separate wires are employed the two outer wires are connected respectively to the positive and the negative bus bars running along the main switchboard these bars receiving positive or negative current directly from the dynamos the outer wires therefore carry current at the full voltage of the system between them is a third and smaller wire connected to a third bar much smaller than the outer bars and known as the mid wire bar this bar is not connected to the dynamos but to earth by means of a large plate of copper sunk into the ground connexion between the mid wire bar and the outer bars is made by two machines called balancers one connecting the mid wire bar and the positive bus bar and the other the mid wire bar and the negative bus bar if the pressure between the outer bars is 440 volts then the pressure between the mid wire bar and either of the outer bars will be 220 volts that is just half ',\n",

       " 'in any electric supply system the demand for current does not remain constant but fluctuates more or less for instance in a system including an electric tramway if a car breaks down and remains a fixture for a short time all cars behind it are held up and a long line of cars is quickly formed when the breakdown is repaired all the cars start practically at the same instant and consequently a sudden and tremendous demand for current is made in a very large tramway system in a fairly level city the fluctuations in the demand for current apart from accidents are not very serious for they tend to average themselves but in a small system and particularly if the district is hilly the fluctuations are very great and the current demand may vary as much as from 400 to 2000 amperes again in a system supplying power and light the current demand rises rapidly as the daylight fails on winter afternoons because while workshop and other motors are still in full swing thousands of electric lamps are switched on more or less at the same time the power station must be able to deal with any exceptional demands which are likely to occur and consequently more current must be available than is actually required under average conditions instead79 of having generating machinery large enough to meet all unusual demands the generators at a station using continuous current may be only of sufficient size to supply a little more than the average demand any current beyond this being supplied by a battery of storage cells the battery is charged during periods when the demand for current is small and when a heavy load comes on the current from the battery relieves the generators of the sudden strain to be of any service for such a purpose the storage battery of course must be very large plate vi shows a large battery of no cells and some idea of the size of the individual cells may be obtained from the fact that each weighs about 3900 lb ',\n",
       " 'alternating current is produced at almost all power stations supplying large districts it is generated at high pressure from 2000 volts upwards the highest pressure employed in this country being about 11 000 volts such pressures are of course very much too high for electric lamps or motors and the object of generating current of this kind is to secure the greatest economy in transmission through the long cables electric energy is measured in watts the watts being obtained by multiplying together the pressure or voltage of the current and its rate of flow or amperage from this it will be seen that providing the product of voltage and amperage remains the same it makes no difference so far as electric energy is concerned whether the current be of high voltage and low amperage or of low voltage and high amperage now in transmitting a current through a long cable there is a certain amount of loss due to the heating of the conductor this heating is caused by the current flow not by the pressure and the heavier the current the greater the heating and the greater the loss this being so it is clear that by decreasing the current flow and correspondingly increasing80 the pressure the loss in transmission will be reduced and this is why alternating current is generated at high pressure when it is to be transmitted to a distance ',\n",
       " 'the kind of alternating current generated is usually that known as three phase current formerly single phase current was in general use but it has been superseded by three phase current because the latter is more economical to generate and to distribute and also more satisfactory for electric motors the actual voltage of the current sent out from the station varies according to the distance to which the current is to be conveyed in the united states and in other countries where current has to be conveyed to places a hundred or even more miles from the station pressures as high as 120 000 volts are in use it is possible to produce alternating current at such pressures directly from the dynamos but in practice this is never done on account of the great liability to breakdown of the insulation instead the current is generated at from 2000 to 10 000 or 11 000 volts and raised to the required pressure before leaving the station by means of a step up transformer we have seen that an induction coil raises or steps up the voltage of the current supplied to it a step up transformer works on the same principle as the induction coil and in passing through it the current is raised in voltage but correspondingly lowered in amperage of course if the pressure of the current generated by the dynamos is already sufficiently high to meet the local requirements the transformer is not used ',\n",
       " 'for town supply the current from the power station is led along underground cables to a number of sub stations situated in different parts of the town and generally underground at each sub station the current passes through a step down transformer which also acts on the principle of the induction coil but in the reverse way so that the voltage is lowered instead of being raised from the transformer the current emerges at the pressure required for use but it is still alternating current and if it is desired to have a continuous current supply this alternating current must be converted one of the simplest arrangements for this purpose consists of an electric motor and a dynamo the two being coupled together the motor is constructed to run on the alternating current from the transformer and it drives the dynamo which is arranged to generate continuous current there is also a machine called a rotary converter which is largely used instead of the motor generator this machine does the work of both motor and dynamo but its action is too complicated to be described here from the sub stations the current whether converted or not is distributed as required by a network of underground cables ',\n",

       " 'the conduit and surface contact systems are much the same as the trolley system except in the method of supplying the current to the cars in the conduit system two conductors conveying the current are placed in an underground channel or conduit of concrete strengthened by iron yokes the top of the conduit is almost closed in so as to leave only a narrow slot through which passes the current collector of the car this current collector or plough as it is called carries two slippers which make contact with the conductors and thus take current from them in this system the current returns along one of the conductors so that no current passes along the track rails this is the most expensive of the three systems both in construction and maintenance ',\n",
       " 'the surface contact or stud system is like the conduit system in having conductors placed in a sort of underground trough but in this case contact with the conductors is made by means of metal studs fixed at intervals in the middle of the track the studs are really the tops of underground boxes each containing a switch which when drawn up to a certain position connects the stud to the conductors these switches are arranged to be moved by magnets fixed beneath the car and thus when the car passes over a stud the magnets work the switch and connect the stud to the conductors so that the stud is then alive the current is taken from the studs by means of sliding brushes or skates which are carried by the car the studs are thus alive only when the car is passing over86 them and at all other times they are dead and not in any way dangerous ',\n",

       " 'the first telegraph of wheatstone and cooke consisted of five magnetic needles pivoted on a vertical dial the letters of the alphabet were marked on the dial and the needles were deflected by currents made to pass through wires by the depression of keys so that two needles would point towards the required letter fig 26 is a sketch of the dial of this apparatus this telegraph was tried successfully on the london and north western railway over a wire a mile and a half in length wheatstone and cooke afterwards invented a single needle telegraph in which the letters were indicated by movements of the needle to the right or to the left according to the direction of a current sent through a coil of wire wheatstone subsequently produced an apparatus which printed the letters on paper ',\n",
       " 'in the united states morse had thought out a scheme of telegraphy in 1832 but it was not until 1837 that he got131 his apparatus into working order he was an artist by profession and for a long time he was unable to develop his ideas for lack of money after many efforts he succeeded in obtaining a state grant of 6000 for the construction of a telegraph line between baltimore and washington and the first message over this line was sent in 1844 the line being thrown open to the public in the following year amongst the features of this telegraph were a receiving instrument which automatically recorded the messages on a moving paper ribbon by means of a pencil actuated by an electro magnet and an apparatus called a relay which enabled the recording instrument to be worked when the current was enfeebled by the resistance of a very long wire morse also devised a telegraphic code which is practically the same as that in use to day ',\n",

       " 'one of the simplest forms of telegraph is the single needle132 instrument this consists of a magnetic needle fixed to a spindle at the back of an upright board through which the spindle is passed on the same spindle but in front of the board is fixed a dial needle which of course moves along with the magnetic needle a coil of wire is passed round the magnetic needle and connected to a commutator for reversing the direction of the current by turning a handle to the left a current is made to flow through the coil and the magnetic needle moves to one side but if the handle is turned to the right the current flows through the coil in the opposite direction and the needle moves to the other side instead of a handle two keys may be used the movement of the needle varying according to which key is pressed a good operator can transmit at the rate of about twenty words a minute with this instrument the morse code which consists of combinations of dots and dashes is used a movement of the dial needle to the left meaning a dot and one to the right a dash the code as used in the single needle instrument is shown in fig 27 ',\n",
       " 'needle instruments are largely used in railway signal133 cabins but for general telegraphic work an instrument called the morse sounder is employed this consists of an electro magnet which when a current is passed through it attracts a small piece of iron fixed to one end of a pivoted lever the other end of this lever moves between two stops at the transmitting station the operator closes a battery circuit by pressing a key when the electro magnet of the sounder at the receiving station attracts the iron and the lever flies from one stop to the other with a sharp click returning again as soon as the circuit is broken a dot is signalled when the lever falls back immediately after the click and a dash when it makes a short stay before returning fig 28 shows the code of signals for the morse telegraph ',\n",
       " 'in passing through a very long wire an electric current becomes greatly reduced in strength owing to the resistance of the wire if two telegraph stations are a great distance apart the energy of the current thus may be unequal to the task of making the electro magnet move the lever of the sounder so as to produce a click but this difficulty is overcome by the use of an ingenious arrangement called a relay it consists of a very small electro magnet which134 attracts a light bar the movement of the bar being made to close the circuit of another battery at the receiving station the feeble current works the relay and the current in the local circuit operates the sounder ',\n",

       " 'a good morse operator can maintain a speed of about thirty words a minute but this is far too slow for certain kinds of telegraphic work such as the transmission of press news and for such work the wheatstone automatic transmitter is used first of all the messages are punched on a paper ribbon this is done by passing the ribbon from right to left by clockwork through a punching machine which is provided with three keys one for dots one for dashes and the other for spaces if the left hand key is pressed two holes opposite to one another are made representing a dot and if the right hand key is pressed 136 two diagonal holes are punched representing a dash in fig 29 which shows a piece of ribbon punched in this way a third line of holes will be noticed between the outside holes representing the dots and dashes these holes are for the purpose of guiding the paper ribbon steadily along through the transmitting machine the punched ribbon is then drawn by clockwork through a wheatstone transmitter in this machine two oscillating needles connected with one pole of a battery are placed below the moving ribbon each time a hole passes these needles make contact with a piece of metal connected with the other pole of the battery thus making and breaking the circuit with much greater rapidity than is possible with the morse key at the receiving station the messages are recorded by a form of morse inker coming out in dots and dashes as though sent by hand below the punched ribbon in fig 29 is shown the corresponding arrangement of dots and dashes the same punched ribbon may be used repeatedly when the message has to be sent on a number of different lines the wheatstone automatic machine is capable of transmitting at the rate of from 250 to 400 words a minute fig 29 is a fragment of a daily telegraph balkan war special as transmitted to the yorkshire post over the latter s private wire from london to leeds in the translation it will be seen that many common words are abbreviated ',\n",
       " 'one weak point of telegraphy with wheatstone instruments is that the messages are received in morse code and have to be translated during recent years telegraphs have been invented which actually produce their messages in ordinary written or printed characters a very ingenious instrument is the hughes printing telegraph which turns out messages in typewritten form its mechanism is too complicated to be described here 137 but in general it consists of a transmitter having a keyboard something like that of a typewriter by means of which currents of electricity are made to press a sheet of paper at the right instant against a revolving type wheel bearing the various characters this telegraph has been modified and brought to considerable perfection and in one form or another it is used in european countries and in the united states ',\n",
       " 'in the pollak virag system of telegraphy the action of light upon sensitized photographic paper is utilized an operator punches special groupings of holes on a paper ribbon about 1 inch wide by means of a perforating machine resembling a typewriter and the ribbon is then passed through a machine which transmits by brush contacts the receiver consists of a very small mirror connected to two vibrating diaphragms which control its movements according to the currents received one diaphragm moving the mirror in a vertical direction and the other in a horizontal direction the mirror reflects a ray of light on to photographic bromide paper in the form of a moving band about 3 inches in width and the combined action of the two diaphragms makes the mirror move so that the ray of light traces out the messages in ordinary alphabetical characters as it moves forward after being acted upon by the light the paper is automatically developed and fixed and then passed through drying rollers although the writing is rather imperfect in formation it is quite legible enough for most messages but trouble occasionally occurs with messages containing figures owing to confusion arising from the similarity of the figures 3 5 and 8 the whole process is carried out with such rapidity that 40 000 or even more words can be transmitted easily in an hour ',\n",
       " 'one of the most remarkable of present day telegraphs is the creed high speed automatic printing telegraph 138 this has been devised to do away with hand working as far as possible and to substitute quicker and more accurate automatic methods in this system a perforated paper tape is produced by a keyboard perforator at the sending station this tape is just ordinary wheatstone tape its perforations representing in the morse code the message to be transmitted and the main advantage of the creed perforator over the three key punching machine already described lies in the ease and speed with which it can be worked the keyboard contains a separate key for each letter or signal of the morse code and the pressing of any key brings into operation certain punches which make the perforations corresponding to that particular letter the perforator can be worked by any one who understands how to use an ordinary typewriter and a speed of about 60 words a minute can be maintained by a fairly skilful operator if desired a number of tapes may be perforated at the same time ',\n",
       " 'the tape prepared in this way is passed through a wheatstone transmitter and long or short currents according to the arrangement of the perforations are sent out along the telegraph line at the receiving station these signals operate a receiving perforator this machine produces another perforated tape which is an exact copy of the tape at the sending station and it turns out this duplicate tape at the rate of from 150 to 200 words a minute there are two forms of this receiving perforator one worked entirely by electricity and the other by a combination of electricity and compressed air both forms serving the same purpose the duplicate tape is then passed through an automatic printer which reproduces the message in large roman characters on a paper tape the printer works at a speed of from 80 to about 100 words a minute and the printed tape is pasted on a telegraphic139 form by a semi automatic process and the message is then ready for delivery plate xi shows a specimen of the tape from the receiving perforator and the corresponding translation as turned out by the printer this message formed part of a leading article in the daily mail some idea of the wonderful capabilities of the creed system may be gained from the fact that by means of it practically the whole contents of the daily mail are telegraphed every night from london to manchester and paris for publication next morning ',\n",
       " 'one of the most remarkable features about present day telegraphy is the ease with which two or more messages can be sent simultaneously over one line duplex telegraphy or the simultaneous transmission of two separate messages in opposite directions over one wire is now practised on almost every line of any importance at first sight duplex telegraphy seems to be an impossibility for if we have two stations one at each end of a single wire and each station fitted with a transmitter and a receiver it appears as if each transmitter would affect not only the receiver at the opposite end of the wire but also the receiver at its own end thus causing hopeless confusion when both transmitters were in use at the same time this actually would be the case with ordinary telegraphic methods but by the use of a special arrangement all confusion in working is avoided ',\n",
       " 'we have seen that a magnetic needle is deflected by a current passing through a coil of wire placed round it and that the direction in which the needle is deflected depends upon the direction of the current in the coil now suppose we place round the needle two coils of wire wound so that the current in one flows in a direction opposite to that of the current in the other then if we pass two equal currents one through each coil it is evident that they will140 neutralize one another so that the needle will not be deflected at all in a duplex system one end of one of these coils is connected to earth say to a copper plate buried in the ground and one end of the other to the line wire the two remaining ends are arranged as branches leading off from a single wire connected with the transmitting key the whole arrangement of coils and needle is repeated at the other end of the line if now the transmitting key at station a is pressed the circuit is closed and a current flows along the single wire and then divides into two where the wire branches half of it taking the path through one coil and half the path through the other equal currents thus flow through the oppositely wound coils and the needle at station a is not deflected leaving the coils one of these equal currents flows away to earth while the other passes out along the line wire on its arrival at station b the current is able to pass through only one of the coils round the needle and consequently the needle is deflected and the signal given in this way the transmitting operator at station a is able to signal to station b without affecting the receiver at his own end and similarly the operator at station b can transmit to a without affecting the b receiver thus there can be no confusion whether the transmitters are worked at different times or simultaneously for each transmitter affects only the receiver at the opposite end of the line the diagram in fig 30 will help to make clearer the general principle k and k are the two transmitting keys which close the circuit and c and c are the points at which the current divides into two instead of coils and needles electro magnets operating sounders may be used such magnets having two separate and oppositely wound coils acting in exactly the same way as the coils round the needles the above description is of course only a rough outline of the141 method and in practice matters are more complicated owing to the necessity for carefully adjusted resistances and for condensers there is also another and different method of duplexing a line but we have not space to describe it duplex telegraphy requires two operators at each end of the line one to send and the other to receive ',\n",

       " 'during the early days of telegraphy overhead lines were a source of considerable danger when thunderstorms were taking place lightning flashes often completely wrecked the instruments giving severe shocks to those in the vicinity and in a few cases operators were killed at their posts danger of this kind is now obviated by the use of contrivances known as lightning arresters there are several forms of these but only one need be mentioned the main features of this are two metal plates separated slightly from one another so that there is a small air gap between them one plate is connected to the line wire 143 and the other to earth almost all lightning flashes consist of an oscillatory discharge that is one which passes a number of times backwards and forwards between a cloud and the earth a very rapidly alternating discharge of this kind finds difficulty in passing along the line wire being greatly impeded by the coils of wire in the various pieces of apparatus and although the resistance of this air gap is very high the lightning discharge will cross the gap sooner than struggle along the line wire in this way when a flash affects the line the discharge jumps the gap between the plates of the arrester and passes away harmlessly to earth without entering the telegraph office at all as was mentioned in chapter iii the prevalence of magnetic storms sometimes renders telegraph lines quite unworkable for a time but although such disturbances cause great delay and general inconvenience they are not likely to be at all dangerous it is often possible to maintain telegraphic communication during magnetic disturbances by using two lines to form a complete metallic loop so that there is no earth return ',\n",
       " 'the story of submarine telegraphy is a wonderful record of dogged perseverance in the face of tremendous obstacles and disastrous failures it would be of no interest to trace the story to its very beginning and so we will commence with the laying of the first cable across the english channel from dover to calais in 1850 a single copper wire covered with a layer of gutta percha half an inch thick was used and leaden weights were attached to it at intervals of one hundred yards the fixing of each weight necessitating the stoppage of the cable laying ship the line was laid successfully but it failed after working for a single day and it afterwards turned out that a boulogne fisherman had hauled up the cable with his trawl this line proved that telegraphic communication between england and france was possible but the enterprise was assailed with every imaginable kind of abuse and ridicule it is said that some people really believed that the cable was worked in the style of the old fashioned house bell and that the signals were given by pulling the wire in the next year another attempt was made by mr t r crampton a prominent railway engineer who himself contributed half of the 15 000 required the form of cable adopted by him consisted of four copper wires each covered with two layers of gutta percha and the four enclosed in a covering formed of ten galvanized iron wires wound spirally round them 145 the line proved a permanent success and this type of cable with certain modifications is still in use in 1852 three attempts were made to connect england and ireland but the first two failed owing to the employment of cables too light to withstand the strong tidal currents and the third was somehow mismanaged as regards the paying out so that there was not enough cable to reach across a heavier cable was tried in the next year and this was a lasting success ',\n",
       " 'the success of these two cables led to the laying of many other european cables over similar distances but we must now pass on to a very much bigger undertaking the laying of the atlantic cable in 1856 the atlantic telegraph company was formed with the object of establishing and working telegraphic communication between ireland and newfoundland the three projectors being messrs j w brett c t bright and c w field the british and the united states governments granted a subsidy in return for which government messages were to have priority over all others and were to be transmitted free the objections launched against the scheme were of course many some of them making very amusing reading it is however very strange to find so eminent a scientist as professor airy then astronomer royal seriously stating that it was a mathematical impossibility to submerge a cable safely to such depths and that even if this could be done messages could not be transmitted through such a great length of cable ',\n",
       " 'it was estimated that a length of about 2500 nautical miles would be enough to allow for all contingencies and the construction of the cable was commenced in february 1857 and completed in june of that year it is difficult to realize the gigantic nature of the task of making a cable of such dimensions the length of copper wire used in146 making the conductor was 20 500 miles while the outer sheathing took 367 500 miles of iron wire the total length of wire used being enough to go round the earth thirteen times the cable was finally stowed away on board two warships one british and the other american ',\n",
       " 'the real troubles began with the laying of the cable after landing the shore end in valentia bay the paying out commenced but scarcely had five miles been laid when the cable caught in the paying out machinery and parted by tracing it from the shore the lost end was picked up and spliced and the paying out began again everything went well for two or three days and then after 380 miles had been laid the cable snapped again owing to some mismanagement of the brakes and was lost at a depth of 2000 fathoms the cable had to be abandoned and the ships returned to plymouth ',\n",
       " 'in the next year 1858 another attempt was made with new and improved machinery and 3000 miles of cable and this time it was decided that the two ships should start paying out from mid ocean proceeding in opposite directions towards the two shores after splicing their cables on the voyage out the expedition encountered one of the most fearful storms on record which lasted over a week and the british man of war encumbered with the dead weight of the cable came near to disaster part of the cable shifted and those on board feared that the whole of the huge mass would break away and crash through the vessel s side sixteen days after leaving plymouth the rendezvous was reached the cables were spliced and the ships started after the british ship had paid out 40 miles it was discovered that the cable had parted at some distance from the ship and the vessels once more sought each other and spliced again ready for another effort this time the cable parted after each vessel had paid out a little more than147 100 miles and the ships were forced to abandon the attempt ',\n",
       " 'the failure of this second expedition naturally caused great discouragement and the general feeling was that the whole enterprise would have to be given up the chairman of the company recommended that in order to make the best of a bad job the remainder of the cable should be sold and the proceeds divided amongst the shareholders but after great efforts on the part of a dauntless few who refused to admit defeat it was finally decided to make one more effort no time was lost and on 17th july 1858 the vessels again sailed from queenstown as before the cables were spliced in mid ocean and this time after many anxious days many false alarms and one or two narrow escapes from disaster through faulty pieces of cable discovered almost too late the cable was landed successfully on both shores of the atlantic early in august ',\n",

       " 'a great consultation of experts took place with the object of determining the cause of the failure and the unanimous opinion was that the cable had been injured by the use of currents of too great intensity some years elapsed before another attempt could be made but the idea was never abandoned and a great deal of study was given to the problems involved mr field the most energetic of the original projectors never relaxed his determination that the cable should be made a success and he worked incessantly to achieve his ambition it is said that in pursuance of his object he made sixty four crossings of the atlantic and considering that he suffered greatly from sea sickness every time this shows remarkable pluck and endurance ',\n",

       " 'in spite of the loss which amounted to 600 000 the energetic promoters contrived to raise fresh capital and in 1866 the great eastern started again this effort was completely successful and on 28th july 1866 the cable was landed amidst great rejoicing the following extracts from the diary of the engineer sir daniell gooch give us some idea of the landing ',\n",

       " 'the practical working of a submarine cable differs in many respects from that of a land telegraph line the currents used in submarine telegraphy are extremely small contrary to the popular impression an insulated cable acts like a leyden jar in the sense that it accumulates electricity and does not quickly part with it as does a bare overhead wire in the case of a very long cable such as one across the atlantic a current continues to flow from it for some time after the battery is disconnected a second signal cannot be sent until the electricity is dissipated and the cable clear and if a powerful current were employed the time occupied in this clearing would be considerable so that the speed of signalling would be slow another objection to a powerful current is that if any flaw exists in the insulation of the cable such a current is apt152 to increase the flaw and finally cause the breakdown of the line ',\n",
       " 'the feebleness of the currents in submarine telegraphy makes it impossible to use the ordinary land telegraph receiver and a more sensitive instrument known as the mirror receiver is used this consists of a coil of very fine wire in the centre of which a tiny magnetic needle is suspended by a fibre of unspun silk a magnet placed close by keeps the needle in one position when no current is flowing as the deflections of the needle are extremely small it is necessary to magnify them in some way and this is done by fixing to the needle a very small mirror upon which falls a ray of light from a lamp the mirror reflects this ray on to a sheet of white paper marked with a scale and as the mirror moves along with the needle the point of light travels over the paper a very small movement of the needle causing the light to travel some inches the receiving operator sits in a darkened room and watches the light which moves to the right or to the left according to the direction of the current the signals employed are the same as those for the single needle instrument a movement to the left indicating a dot and one to the right a dash in many instruments the total weight of magnet and mirror is only two or three grains and the sensitiveness is such that the current from a voltaic cell consisting of a lady s silver thimble with a few drops of acidulated water and a diminutive rod of zinc is sufficient to transmit a message across the atlantic ',\n",
       " 'the mirror receiver cannot write down its messages and for recording purposes an instrument invented by lord kelvin and called the siphon recorder is used in this instrument a coil of wire is suspended between the poles of an electro magnet and to it is connected by means of a silk fibre a delicate glass tube or siphon one end of the153 siphon dips into an ink well and capillary attraction causes the ink to fill the siphon the other end of the siphon almost touches a moving paper ribbon placed beneath it the ink and the paper are oppositely electrified and the attraction between the opposite charges causes the ink to spurt out of the siphon in very minute drops which fall on to the paper as long as no current is passing the siphon remains stationary but when a current flows from the cable through the coil the latter moves to one side or the other according to the direction of the current and makes the siphon move also consequently instead of a straight line along the middle of the paper ribbon a wavy line with little peaks on each side of the centre is produced by the minute drops of ink this recorder sometimes refuses to work properly in damp weather owing to the loss of the opposite charges on ink and paper but a later inventor named cuttriss has removed this trouble by using a siphon kept constantly in vibration by electro magnetism the ordinary single needle code is used for the siphon recorder ',\n",

       " 'if we strike a tuning fork and then hold it close to the ear we hear that it produces a sound and at the same time from a slight sensation in the hand we become aware that the fork is in vibration as the fork vibrates it disturbs the tiny particles of air round it and sets them vibrating and these vibrations are communicated from one particle to another until they reach the drum of the ear when that also begins to vibrate and we hear a sound this is only another way of saying that the disturbances of the air caused by the vibrations of the tuning fork are propagated in a series of waves which we call sound waves sound is transmitted better through liquids than through the air and155 better still through solids and this is why words spoken so softly as to be inaudible through the air at a distance of say 100 feet can be heard fairly distinctly at that distance by means of the string telephone the sound reaches us along the string in exactly the same way as through the air that is by means of minute impulses passed on from particle to particle ',\n",
       " 'a more satisfactory arrangement than the string telephone consists of two thin plates of metal connected by a wire which is stretched very tightly words spoken close to one plate are heard by a listener at the other plate up to a considerable distance let us try to see exactly what takes place when this apparatus is used in the act of speaking vibrations are set up in the air and these in turn set up vibrations in the metal plate the vibrations are then communicated to the wire and to the metal plate at the other end and finally the vibrations of this plate produce vibrations in the air between the plate and the listener and the sound reaches the ear ',\n",
       " 'this simple experiment shows the remarkable fact that a plate of metal is able to reproduce faithfully all the vibrations communicated to it by the human voice and from this fact it follows that if we can communicate the vibrations set up in one plate by the voice to another plate at a distance of 100 miles we shall be able to speak to a listener at the further plate just as if he were close to us a stretched string or wire transmits the vibrations fairly well up to a certain distance but beyond this distance the vibrations become weaker and weaker until no sound at all reaches the air by the aid of electricity however we can transmit the vibrations to a tremendous distance the range being limited only by the imperfections of our apparatus ',\n",
       " 'the first attempt at the construction of an electric telephone that is an instrument by means of which the156 vibrations set up by the voice or by a musical instrument are transmitted by electricity was made in 1860 by johann philipp reis a teacher in a school at friedrichsdorf in germany his transmitting apparatus consisted of a box having a hole covered by a tightly stretched membrane to which was attached a little strip of platinum when the membrane was made to vibrate by sounds produced close to the box the strip of platinum moved to and fro against a metal tip which closed the circuit of a battery the receiver was a long needle of soft iron round which was wound a coil of wire and the ends of the needle rested on two little bridges of a sounding box the vibrations of the membrane opened and closed the circuit at a great speed and the rapid magnetization of the needle produced a tone of the same pitch as the one which set the membrane vibrating this apparatus transmitted musical sounds and melodies with great accuracy but there is considerable difference of opinion as to whether it was able to transmit speech professor sylvanus thompson distinctly states that reis s telephone could and did transmit speech but other experts dispute the fact we probably shall be quite safe in concluding that this telephone did transmit speech but very imperfectly in any case it is certain that the receiver of this apparatus is not based on the same principle as the modern telephone receiver ',\n",
       " 'some years later graham bell professor of vocal physiology in the university of boston turned his attention to the electric transmission of speech probably being led to do so from his experiments in teaching the deaf and dumb his apparatuses shown at an exhibition in philadelphia in 1876 consisted of a tube having one end open for speaking into and the other closed by a tightly stretched membrane to which was attached a very light steel bar magnet the vibrations set up in the membrane by the voice made the157 little magnet move to and fro in front of the poles of an electro magnet inserted in a battery circuit thus inducing currents of electricity in the coils of the latter magnet the currents produced in this way varied in direction and strength according to the vibratory movements of the membrane and being transmitted along a wire they produced similar variations in current in another electro magnet in the receiver the currents produced in this manner in the receiver set up vibrations in a metal diaphragm in front of the magnet poles and so the words spoken into the transmitter were reproduced ',\n",
       " 'since the year 1876 the telephone has developed with remarkable rapidity and an attempt to trace its growth would involve a series of detailed descriptions of closely similar inventions which would be quite uninteresting to most readers now therefore that we have introduced the instruments and seen something of its principle and its early forms it will be most satisfactory to omit the intermediate stages and to go on to the telephone as used in recent years the first telephone to come into general use was the invention of graham bell and was an improved form of his early instrument just described a case or tube of ebonite which forms the handle of the instrument contains a steel bar magnet having a small coil of insulated wire at the end nearest the mouthpiece of the tube the ends of the coil passing along the tube to be connected to the line wires close to the coil end of the magnet and between it and the mouthpiece is fixed a diaphragm of thin sheet iron a complete outfit consists of two of these instruments connected by wires and it will be noticed that no battery is employed ',\n",
       " 'the air vibrations set up by the voice make the diaphragm vibrate also so that it moves backwards and forwards these movements are infinitesimally small but158 they are sufficient to affect the lines of force of the magnet to such an extent that rapidly alternating currents of varying degrees of strength are set up in the coil and sent along the line wire on arriving at the receiver these currents pass through the coil and produce rapid variations in the strength of the magnet so that instead of exerting a uniform attraction upon the iron diaphragm the magnet pulls it with constantly varying force and thus sets it vibrating the air in front of the diaphragm now begins to vibrate and the listener hears a reproduction of the words spoken into the transmitter the way in which the fluctuations of the current make the second diaphragm vibrate exactly in accordance with the first is very remarkable and it is important to notice that the listener does not hear the actual voice of the speaker but a perfect reproduction of it in fact the second diaphragm speaks ',\n",
       " 'the reader probably will be surprised to be told that the transmitter and the receiver of a magneto electric telephone are respectively a dynamo and electric motor of minute proportions we provide a dynamo with mechanical motion and it gives us electric current and by sending this current through an electric motor we get mechanical motion back again in the transmitter of the telephone just described the mechanical motion is in the form of vibrations of the metal diaphragm which set up currents of electricity in the coil of wire round the magnet so that the transmitter is really a tiny dynamo driven by the voice the receiver is provided with electric current from the transmitter and it converts this into mechanical motion in the diaphragm so that the receiver is a little electric motor ',\n",
       " 'transmitters of the type just described work well over short distances but the currents they produce are too feeble for transmission over a very long wire and on this account they have been superseded by transmitters on the microphone159 principle a microphone is an instrument for making extremely small sounds plainly audible if a current is passed through a box containing loose bits of broken carbon it meets with great resistance but if the bits of carbon are compressed their conducting power is considerably increased even such slight differences in pressure as are produced by vibrating the box will affect the amount of current passing through the carbon if this current is led by wires to an ordinary telephone receiver the arrangement becomes a simple form of microphone the vibrations of the box vary the resistance of the carbon and the corresponding variations in the current set up vibrations in the receiver but in a magnified form the smallest sound vibrations alter the resistance of the carbon and as these vibrations are magnified in the receiver the reproduced sound is magnified also the footsteps of a fly may be heard quite distinctly by means of a good microphone and the ticks of a watch sound like the strokes of a hammer ',\n",
       " 'by means of this power of magnifying vibrations a microphone transmitter can be used on a line of tremendous length where an ordinary bell transmitter would be utterly useless the general features of this transmitter fig 31 are a diaphragm and a block of carbon separated slightly from one another the intervening space being filled with granules of carbon these are enclosed in a case of ebonite having a mouthpiece in front and two terminals behind one terminal being connected with the carbon block160 and the other with the diaphragm from these terminals wires are led to a battery and to the receiver which is of the bell type the current has to pass through the carbon granules and the movements of the diaphragm when set in vibration by the voice vary the pressure upon the granules and in this way set up variations in the current carbon dust also may be used instead of granular carbon and then the instrument is called a dust transmitter ',\n",
       " 'it is usual to have a transmitter and a receiver on one handle for the greater convenience of the user the arrangement is shown in fig 32 and it will be seen that when the user places the receiver to his ear the transmitting mouthpiece is in position for speaking the microphone with its carbon dust is placed at a just below the mouthpiece and the earpiece or receiver b contains a little magnet and coil with a diaphragm in front so that it is really a bell instrument a little lever will be noticed at c this is a switch which brings the transmitter into circuit on being pressed with the finger ',\n",
       " 'it is now time to see something of the arrangement and working of telephone systems as soon as the telephone became a commercially practicable instrument the necessity for some means of inter communication became evident and the telephone exchange was brought into being the first exchange was started in 1877 in boston but this was a very small affair and it was run on very crude lines when one subscriber wished to communicate with another he had to call up an operator who received the message and repeated it to the person for whom it was intended 161 there was no direct communication between the various subscribers instruments as the number of users increased it became necessary to devise some system whereby each subscriber could call the attention of an operator at the central station and be put into direct communication with any other subscriber without delay and the exchange system of to day which fulfils these requirements almost to perfection is the result of gradual improvements in telephone methods extending over some thirty five years ',\n",
       " 'when a subscriber wishes to telephone he first must call up the operator at the exchange until comparatively recently this was done by turning a handle placed at the side of the instrument this handle operated a little dynamo and the current produced caused a shutter at the exchange to drop and reveal a number just as in the electric bell indicator so that the operator knew which instrument was calling as soon as the operator answered the call the shutter replaced itself automatically the signal to disconnect was given in the same way but the indicator was of a different colour in order to prevent confusion with a call signal these handle operated telephones are still in common use but they are being replaced by instruments which do away with handle turning on the part of the subscriber and with dropping shutters at the exchange in this latest system all that the subscriber has to do is to lift his telephone from its rest when a little electric lamp lights up at the exchange and when he has finished his conversation he merely replaces the telephone and again a little lamp glows ',\n",
       " 'we must now see what happens at the exchange when a call is made each operator has control of a number of pairs of flexible cords terminating in plugs the two cords of each pair being electrically connected the plugs rest162 on a shelf in front of the operator and the cords pass through the shelf and hang down below it if a plug is lifted the cord comes up through the shelf and it is drawn back again by a weight when the plug is not in use two lamps are provided for each pair of cords one being fixed close to each cord the two wires leading from each subscriber s instrument are connected to a little tube shaped switch called a jack and each jack has a lamp of its own when a subscriber lifts his telephone from its rest a lamp glows and the operator inserts one plug of a pair into the jack thus indicated and the lamp goes out automatically she then switches on her telephone to the caller and asks for the number of the subscriber to whom he wishes to speak and as soon as she gets this she inserts the other plug of the pair into the jack belonging to this number by a simple movement she then rings up the required person by switching on the current to his telephone bell ',\n",
       " 'here comes in the use of the two lamps connected with the cords as long as the subscribers telephones are on their rests the lamps are lighted but as soon as they are lifted off the lamps go out the caller s telephone is of course off its rest and so the lamp connected with the first cord is not lit but until the subscriber rung up lifts his instrument to answer the call the lamp of the second cord remains lit having first lighted up when the plug was inserted in the jack of his number when the second lamp goes out the operator knows that the call has been responded to and that the two subscribers are in communication with each other having finished their conversation both subscribers replace their instruments on the rests whereupon both lamps light up informing the operator that she may disconnect by pulling out the plugs ',\n",
       " 'it is manifestly impossible for one operator to attend to the calls of all the subscribers in the exchange and so a163 number of operators are employed each one having to attend to the calls of a certain number of subscribers at the same time it is clear that each operator may be called upon to connect one of her subscribers to any other subscriber in the whole exchange in order to make this possible the switchboard is divided into sections each having as many jacks as there are lines in the exchange so that in this respect all the sections are multiples of each other and the whole arrangement is called a multiple switchboard the repeated jacks being called multiple jacks then there are other jacks which it is not necessary to duplicate we have seen that when a subscriber calls the exchange a lamp glows and the operator inserts a plug into the jack beside the lamp in order to answer the call and ascertain what number is required these are called answering jacks and the lamp is the line signal it is usual to have three operators to each section of the switchboard and each operator has charge of so many answering jacks representing so many subscribers at the same time she has access to the whole section so that she can connect any of her subscribers to any other line in the exchange ',\n",
       " 'when a number is called for the operator must be able to tell at once whether the line is free or not the jack in her section may be unoccupied but she must know also whether all the multiple jacks belonging to that number are free for an operator at another section may have connected the line to one of her subscribers to enable an operator to ascertain this quickly an electrical test is provided when two lines are connected the whole of the multiple jacks belonging to each are charged with electricity and if an operator at any section touches one of these jacks with a plug a current through her receiver makes a click and on hearing the click she knows that the line is engaged 164 the testing takes an extremely short time and this is why a caller receives the reply number engaged so promptly that he feels inclined to doubt whether the operator has made any attempt at all to connect him up to the number ',\n",
       " 'in order that an operator may have both hands free to manipulate the plugs her telephone receiver is fixed over one ear by a fastening passing over her head and the transmitter is hung from her shoulders so as to be close to her mouth ',\n",
       " 'in telegraphy it is the rule to employ the earth for the return part of the circuit but this is not customary in telephony the telephone is a much more sensitive instrument than the telegraph and a telephone having an earth return is subject to all kinds of strange and weird noises which greatly interfere with conversation these noises may be caused by natural electrical disturbances or by the proximity of telegraph and other wires conveying electric currents on this account telephone lines are made with a complete metallic circuit as in telegraphy protection from lightning flashes is afforded by lightning arresters the current for the working of a telephone exchange is supplied from a central battery of accumulators and also from dynamos ',\n",
       " 'although the manual exchange telephone system of to day works with remarkable efficiency it has certain weak points for instance if an operator cares to do so she can listen to conversations between subscribers so that privacy cannot be assured as a matter of fact the operators have little time for this kind of thing at any rate during the busy hours of the day and as a rule they are not sufficiently interested in other people s affairs to make any attempt to listen to their remarks the male operators who work through the slack hours of the night are occasionally guilty of listening some time ago the writer had to ring up a friend in the very early morning and during the conversation this gentleman asked what time it was before the writer had time to get a word out a deep bass voice from the exchange replied half past two little incidents of this sort remind one that it is not wise to speak too freely by telephone then again operators are liable to make wrong connexions through faulty hearing of the number called for and these are equally annoying to the caller and to the person rung up in mistake many other defects might be mentioned but these are sufficient to show that the manual system is not perfect ',\n",
       " 'for a long time inventors have been striving to do away with all such defects by abolishing the exchange operators and substituting mechanism to work the exchanges automatically and during the last few years the system of the automatic electric company of chicago has been brought to great perfection this system is in extensive use in the united states and is employed in two or three exchanges in this country unfortunately the mechanism of this system is extremely complicated so that it is impossible to describe it fully in a book of this kind but some idea of the method of working may be given without entering into technical details ',\n",
       " 'each subscriber s telephone instrument is fitted with a dial which turns round on a pivot at its centre this dial has a series of holes round its circumference numbered consecutively from 1 to 9 and 0 suppose now a subscriber wishes to speak to a friend whose telephone number is 2583 he removes the receiver from its hook places his finger in the hole marked 2 and turns the dial round in a clockwise direction until his finger comes in contact with a stop he then removes his finger and the dial automatically returns to its original position he then places his finger in the hole marked 5 and again turns the166 dial as far as the stop and when the dial has returned to the normal position he repeats the process with his finger placed successively in the holes marked 8 and 3 he now places the receiver to his ear and by the time he has done this the automatic mechanism at the exchange has made the necessary connexions and has rung the bell of subscriber number 2583 on completing the conversation each subscriber returns his receiver to its hook and the exchange mechanism returns to its normal position ',\n",
       " 'the turning of the dial by the finger coils up a spring and this spring acting along with a speed governor makes the dial return to its first position at a certain definite speed as soon as the finger is removed during this retrograde movement a switch automatically sends out into the line a certain number of impulses the number being determined by the hole in which the finger is placed in the case supposed groups of two five eight and three impulses respectively would be sent out each group separated from the next by an interval during which the subscriber is turning the dial ',\n",
       " 'now let us see what takes place at the exchange the subscriber s instrument is connected to a mechanical arrangement known as a line switch this switch is brought into play by the act of removing the receiver from its hook and it then automatically connects the subscriber s line to what is called a first selector switch the group of two impulses sent out by the first turning of the dial raises this first selector two steps and it then sweeps along a row of contacts connected to trunks going to the 2000 section passing by occupied trunks it finds an idle one and so connects the line to an idle second selector this selector is operated by the second group of impulses five in number and after being raised five steps it acts like the first selector and finds an idle167 trunk leading to the 2500 section this places the caller s line in connexion with still another switch called a connector and this switch operated by the remaining groups of eight and three impulses finds the required tens section and selects the third member of that section if the number 2583 is disengaged the connector switch now sends current from the central battery to this instrument thus ringing its bell and it also supplies speaking current to the two lines during the conversation restores the exchange mechanism to its original condition as soon as the conversation is ended and the subscribers have hung up their receivers and registers the call on the calling subscriber s meter if the connector finds the number engaged it sends out an intermittent buzzing sound to inform the caller of the fact all these operations take time to describe even in outline but in practice they are carried out with the utmost rapidity each step in the connecting up process taking only a small fraction of a second ',\n",
       " 'for ordinary local calls the automatic system requires no operators at all but for the convenience of users there are usually two clerks at the exchange one to give any information required by subscribers and the other to record complaints regarding faulty working for trunk calls the subscriber places his finger in the hole marked 0 and gives the dial one turn this connects him to an operator at the trunk switchboard who makes the required connexion and then calls him up in the usual way ',\n",
       " 'it might be thought that the complex mechanism of an automatic exchange would constantly be getting out of order but it is found to work with great smoothness each automatic switchboard has a skilled electrician in attendance and he is informed instantly of any faulty working by means of supervisory lamps and other signals even without these signals the attendant would be quickly168 aware of any breakdown for his ear becomes so accustomed to the sounds made by the apparatus during the connecting up that any abnormal sound due to faulty connecting attracts his attention at once however detected the faults are put right immediately and it often happens that a defective line is noted and repaired before the subscriber knows that anything is wrong ',\n",
       " 'on account of its high speed in making connexions and disconnexions its absolute accuracy and its privacy the automatic telephone system has proved most popular wherever it has been given a fair trial its advantages are most obvious in large city exchanges where the traffic during business hours is tremendously heavy and it is probable that before very long the automatic system will have replaced manual methods for all such exchanges ',\n",
       " 'the telephone system is more highly developed in the united states than in this country and some of the exchanges have been made to do a great deal more than simply transmit messages for instance in chicago there is a system by which a subscriber on connecting himself to a special circuit is automatically informed of the correct time by means of phonographs between the hours of 8 a m and 10 p m new york goes further than this however and has a regular system of news circulation by telephone according to electricity the daily programme is as follows 8 a m exact astronomical time 8 to 9 a m weather reports london stock exchange news special news item 9 to 9 30 a m sales amusements business events 9 45 to 10 a m personal news small notices 10 to 10 30 a m new york stock exchange and market news 11 30 a m to 12 noon local news miscellaneous 12 noon exact astronomical time latest telegrams military and parliamentary news 2 to 2 15 p m european cables 1 15 to 2 30 p m washington news 2 30 to 2 45 p m 169 fashions ladies news 2 45 to 3 15 p m sporting and theatrical news 3 15 to 3 30 p m closing news from wall street 3 30 to 5 p m musical news recitals etc 5 to 6 p m feuilleton sketches literary news 8 to 10 30 p m selected evening performance music opera recitations considering the elaborate nature of this scheme one might imagine that the subscription would be high but as a matter of fact it is only six shillings per month ',\n",
       " 'the telephone has proved of great value in mine rescue work in providing means of communication between the rescue party and those in the rear this end is achieved by means of a portable telephone but as the members of a rescue party often wear oxygen helmets the ordinary telephone mouthpiece is of no use to overcome this difficulty the transmitter is fastened round the throat the vibrations of the vocal cords pass through the wall of the throat and thus operate the transmitter the receiver is fixed over one ear by means of suitable head gear and the connecting wire is laid by the advancing rescuers a case containing some hundreds of feet of wire is strapped round the waist and as the wearer walks forward this wire pays itself out automatically ',\n",
       " 'by the time that the telephone came to be a really practical instrument capable of communicating over long distances on land the atlantic telegraph cable was in operation and an attempt was made to telephone from one continent to the other by means of it but without success in speaking of submarine telegraphy in chapter xvii we saw that the cable acts like a leyden jar and it was this fact that made it impossible to telephone through more than about 20 miles of cable so that transatlantic telephony was quite out of the question it was evident that little progress could be made in this direction unless some means could be devised for neutralizing this capacity effect as it170 is called of the cable and finally it was discovered that this could be done by inserting at intervals along the cable a number of coils of wire these coils are known as loading coils and a cable provided with them is called a loaded cable such cables have been laid across various narrow seas such as between england and france and england and ireland and these have proved very successful for telephonic communication the problem of transatlantic telephony however still remains to be solved experiments have been made in submarine telephony over a bare iron cable instead of the usual insulated cable conversations have been carried on in this way without difficulty between seattle washington u s a and vashon island a total distance of about 11 miles and it is possible that uninsulated cables may play an extremely important part in the development of submarine telephony ',\n",
       " 'in telegraphy messages not only may be received but also recorded by the morse printer or one of its modifications but in ordinary telephony there is no mechanical method of recording messages this means that we can communicate by telephone only when we can call up somebody to receive the message at the other end and if no one happens to be within hearing of the telephone bell we are quite helpless this is always annoying and if the message is urgent the delay may be serious several arrangements for overcoming this difficulty by means of automatic recording mechanism have been invented but the only really successful one is the telegraphone ',\n",
       " 'this instrument is the invention of waldemar poulsen whose apparatus for wireless telegraphy we shall speak of in the next chapter the telegraphone performs at the same time the work of a telephone and of a phonograph in the ordinary type of phonograph the record is made in the form of depressions or indentations on the surface of a cylinder of wax these indentations being produced by a stylus actuated by vibrations set up in a diaphragm by the act of speaking in the telegraphone the same result is obtained entirely by electro magnetic action the wax cylinder of the phonograph is replaced by a steel wire or ribbon and the recording stylus by an electro magnet 172 the steel ribbon is arranged to travel along over two cylinders or reels kept in constant rotation and a small electro magnet is fixed midway between the cylinders so that the ribbon passes close above it this magnet is connected to the telephone line so that its magnetism fluctuates in accordance with the variations in the current in the line we have seen that steel retains magnetism imparted to it in passing over the electro magnet the steel ribbon is magnetized in constantly varying degrees corresponding exactly with the variations in the line current set up by the speaker s voice and these magnetic impressions are retained by the ribbon when the speaker has finished the telephone line is disconnected the ribbon is carried back to the point at which it started and the apparatus is connected to the telephone receiver the ribbon now moves forward again and this time it acts like the speaker s voice the varying intensity of its magnetic record producing corresponding variations in the strength of the magnet so causing the receiver diaphragm to reproduce the sounds in the ordinary way ',\n",
       " 'the magnetic record made in this manner is fairly permanent and if desired it may be reproduced over and over again in most cases however a permanent record is of no value and so the magnetic impressions are obliterated in order that the ribbon may be used to take a new record this can be done by passing a permanent magnet along the ribbon but it is more convenient to have an automatic obliterating arrangement this consists of another electro magnet fixed close to the recording magnet so that the ribbon passes over it before reaching the latter the obliterating magnet is connected with a battery and its unvarying magnetism destroys all traces of the previous record and the ribbon passes forward to the recording magnet ready to receive new impressions ',\n",

       " 'for recording telephone messages the telegraphone is attached to the telephone instrument and by automatically operated switches it is set working by a distant speaker it records all messages received during the absence of its owner who on his return connects it to his receiver and thus hears a faithful reproduction of every word by speaking into his instrument before going out the owner can leave a message stating the time at which he expects to return and this message will be repeated by the telegraphone to anybody ringing up in the meantime the most recent forms of telegraphone are capable of recording speeches over an hour in length and their reproduction is as clear as that of any phonograph indeed in many respects it is considerably more perfect ',\n",
       " 'another electrical apparatus for recording speech may be mentioned this rejoices in the uncouth name of the photographophone and it is the invention of ernst ruhmer a german its working is based upon the fact that the intensity of the light of the electric arc may be varied by sound vibrations each variation in the latter producing a corresponding variation in the amount of light in the photographophone the light of an arc lamp is passed through a lens which focuses it upon a moving photographic film by speaking or singing the light is made to vary in brilliance and proportionate effects are produced in the silver bromide of the film on developing the film a permanent record of the changes in the light intensity is obtained in the form of shadings of different degrees of darkness the film is now moved forward from end to end in front of a fairly powerful lamp the light passes through the film and falls upon a sort of plate made of selenium this is a non metallic substance which possesses the curious property of altering its resistance to an electric current according to the amount of light falling upon it 174 the greater the amount of light the more current will the selenium allow to pass the selenium plate is connected with a telephone receiver and with a battery as the film travels along its varying shadings allow an ever changing amount of light to pass through and fall upon the selenium which varies its resistance accordingly the resulting variations in the current make the receiver diaphragm give out a series of sounds which are exact reproductions of the original sounds made by the voice the reproduction of speech by the photographophone is quite good but as a rule it is not so perfect as with the telegraphone ',\n",
       " 'about ten years ago a german inventor professor a korn brought out the first really practical method of telegraphing drawings or photographs this invention is remarkable not only for what it accomplishes but perhaps still more for the ingenuity with which the many peculiar difficulties of the process are overcome like the photographophone korn s photo telegraphic apparatus utilizes the power of selenium to alter its resistance with the amount of light reaching it ',\n",
       " 'almost everybody is familiar with the terms positive and negative as used in photography the finished paper print is a positive with light and shade in the correct positions while the glass plate from which the print is made is a negative with light and shade reversed the lantern slide also is a positive and it is exactly like the paper print except that it has a base of glass instead of paper so that it is transparent similarly a positive may be made on a piece of celluloid and this besides being transparent is flexible the first step in transmitting on the korn system is to make from the photograph to be telegraphed a positive of this kind both transparent and flexible this is bent round a glass drum or cylinder and fixed so that it cannot possibly move the cylinder is given a twofold movement 175 it is rotated by means of an electric motor and at the same time it is made to travel slowly along in the direction of its length in fact its movement is very similar to that of a screw which turns round and moves forward at the same time a powerful beam of light is concentrated upon the positive this beam remains stationary but owing to the dual movement of the cylinder it passes over every part of the positive following a spiral path exactly the same effect would be produced by keeping the cylinder still and moving the beam spirally round it but this arrangement would be more difficult to manipulate the forward movement of the cylinder is extremely small so that the spiral is as fine as it is possible to get it without having adjacent lines actually touching the light passes through the positive into the cylinder and is reflected towards a selenium cell and as the positive has an almost infinite number of gradations of tone or degrees of light and shade the amount of light reaching the cell varies constantly all the time the selenium therefore alters its resistance and allows a constantly varying current to pass through it and so to the transmission line ',\n",
       " 'at the receiving end is another cylinder having the same rotating and forward movement and round this is fixed a sensitive photographic film this film is protected by a screen having a small opening and no light can reach it except through this aperture the incoming current is made to control a beam of light focused to fall upon the screen aperture the amount of light varying according to the amount of current in this way the beam of light like the one at the transmitting end traces a spiral from end to end of the film and on developing the film a reproduction of the original photograph is obtained the telegraphed photograph is thus made up of an enormous number176 of lines side by side but these are so close to one another that they are scarcely noticed and the effect is something like that of a rather coarse grained ordinary photograph ',\n",
       " 'it is obvious that the success of this method depends upon the maintaining of absolute uniformity in the motion of the two cylinders and this is managed in a very ingenious way it will be remembered that one method of securing uniformity in a number of sub clocks under the control of a master clock is that of adjusting the sub clocks to go a little faster than the master clock then when the sub clocks reach the hour they are held back by electro magnetic action until the master clock arrives at the hour when all proceed together ',\n",
       " 'a similar method is employed for the cylinders they are driven by electric motors and the motor at the receiving end is adjusted so as to run very slightly faster than the motor at the sending end the result is that the receiving cylinder completes one revolution a minute fraction of a second before the transmitting cylinder it is then automatically held back until the sending cylinder completes its revolution and then both commence the next revolution exactly together the pause made by the receiving cylinder is of extremely short duration but in order that there shall be no break in the spiral traced by light upon the film the pause takes place at the point where the ends of the film come together in actual practice certain other details of adjustment are required to ensure precision in working but the main features of the process are as described ',\n",
       " 'although the above photo telegraphic process is very satisfactory in working it has been superseded to some extent by another process of a quite different nature by copying the original photograph through a glass screen177 covered with a multitude of very fine parallel lines a half tone reproduction is made this is formed of an immense number of light and dark lines of varying breadth and it is printed in non conducting ink on lead foil so that while the dark lines are bare foil the light ones are covered with the ink this half tone is placed round a metal cylinder having the same movement as the cylinders in the previous processes and a metal point or stylus as it is called is made to rest lightly upon the foil picture so that it travels all over it from one end to the other an electrical circuit is arranged so that when the stylus touches a piece of the bare foil a current is sent out along the line wire this current is therefore intermittent being interrupted each time the stylus passes over a part of the half tone picture covered with the non conducting ink the succeeding periods of current and no current varying with the breadth of the conducting and the non conducting lines this intermittent current goes to a similar arrangement of stylus and cylinder at the receiving end this cylinder having round it a sheet of paper coated with a chemical preparation the coating is white all over to begin with but it turns black wherever the current passes through it the final result is that the intermittent current builds up a reproduction in black and white of the original photograph in this process also the cylinders have to be synchronized or adjusted to run at the same speed both this process and the foregoing one have been used successfully for the transmission of press photographs notably by the daily mirror ',\n",

       " 'the idea of communicating without any connecting wires is an old one about the year 1842 morse of telegraph fame succeeded in transmitting telegraphic signals across rivers and canals without a connecting wire his method was to stretch along each bank of the river a wire equal in length to three times the breadth of the river one of these wires was connected with the transmitter and with a battery and the other with a receiver both wires terminating in copper plates sunk in the water in this case the water took the place of a connecting wire and acted as the conducting medium a few years later another investigator a scotchman named lindsay succeeded in telegraphing across the river tay at a point where it is over a mile and a half wide by similar methods lindsay appears to have been the first to suggest the possibility of telegraphing across the atlantic and although at that time 1845 the idea must have seemed a wild one he had the firmest faith in its ultimate accomplishment ',\n",
       " 'amongst those who followed lindsay s experiments with keen interest was the late sir william then mr preece but it was not until 1882 twenty years after lindsay s death that he commenced experiments on his own account in march of that year the cable across the solent failed and preece took the opportunity of trying to signal across without a connecting wire he used two overhead wires each terminating in large copper plates sunk in the sea one stretching from southampton to southsea pier and the other from ryde pier to sconce point the experiment was successful audible morse signals being received on each side in this experiment as in those of morse and lindsay the water acted as the conducting medium but a year or two later preece turned his attention to a different method of wireless communication by means of induction this method was181 based upon the fact that at the instant of starting and stopping a current in one wire another current is induced in a second wire placed parallel to it even when the two wires are a considerable distance apart many successful experiments in this induction telegraphy were made one of the most striking being that between the island of mull and the mainland in 1895 the cable between the island and the mainland had broken and by means of induction perfect telegraphic communication was maintained during the time that the cable was being repaired although this system of wireless telegraphy is quite successful for short distances it becomes impracticable when the distance is increased because the length of each of the two parallel wires must be roughly equal to the distance between them these experiments of preece are of great interest but we must leave them because they have little connexion with present day wireless telegraphy in which utterly different methods are used ',\n",
       " 'all the commercial wireless systems of to day depend upon the production and transmission of electric waves about the year 1837 it was discovered that the discharge of a leyden jar did not consist of only one sudden rush of electricity but of a series of electric oscillations which surged backwards and forwards until electric equilibrium was restored this discovery was verified by later experimenters and it forms the foundation of our knowledge of electric waves at this point many readers probably will ask what are electric waves it is impossible to answer this question fully for we still have a great deal to learn about these waves and we only can state the conclusions at which our greatest scientists have arrived after much thought and many experiments it is believed that all space is filled with a medium to which the name ether has been given and that this ether extends182 throughout the matter we do not know what the ether is but the important fact is that it can receive and transmit vibrations in the form of ether waves there are different kinds of ether waves and they produce entirely different effects some of them produce the effect which we call light and these are called light waves others produce the effect known as heat and they are called heat waves and still others produce electricity and these we call electric waves these waves travel through the ether at the enormous speed of 186 000 miles per second so that they would cross the atlantic ocean in about 1 80 second the fact that light also travels at this speed suggested that there might be some connexion between the two sets of waves and after much experiment it has been demonstrated that the waves of light and electricity are identical except in their length ',\n",
       " 'later on in this chapter we shall have occasion to refer frequently to wave length and we may take this opportunity of explaining what is understood by this term wave length is the distance measured from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next across the intervening trough or hollow from this it will be seen that the greater the wave length the farther apart are the waves and also that if we have two sets of waves of different wave lengths but travelling at the same speed then the number of waves arriving at any point in one second will be greater in the case of the shorter waves because these are closer together ',\n",
       " 'a tuning fork in vibration disturbs the surrounding air and sets up air waves which produce the effect called sound when they strike against the drums of our ears in a similar way the discharge of a leyden jar disturbs the surrounding ether and sets up electric ether waves but these waves produce no effect upon us in the shape of sight sound or feeling there is however a very simple piece183 of apparatus which acts as a sort of electric eye or ear and detects the waves for us this consists of a glass tube loosely filled with metal filings and having a cork at each end a wire is passed through each cork so as to project well into the tube but so that the two ends do not touch one another and the outer ends of these wires are connected to a battery of one or two cells and to some kind of electrically worked apparatus such as an electric bell so long as the filings lie quite loosely in the tube they offer a very high resistance and no current passes if now electric waves are set up by the discharge of a leyden jar these waves fall upon the tube and cause the resistance of the filings to decrease greatly the filings now form a conducting path through which the current passes and so the bell rings if no further discharge takes place the electric waves cease but the filings do not return to their original highly resistant condition but retain their conductivity and the current continues to pass and the bell goes on ringing to stop the bell it is only necessary to tap the tube gently when the filings immediately fall back into their first state so that the current cannot pass through them ',\n",
       " 'now let us see how the coherer as the filings tube is called is used in actual wireless telegraphy fig 33a shows a simple arrangement for the purpose a is an induction coil and b the battery supplying the current the coil is fitted with a spark gap consisting of two highly polished brass balls cc one of these balls being connected to a vertical wire supported by a pole and the other to earth d is a morse key for starting and stopping the current when the key is pressed down current flows from the battery to the coil and in passing through the coil it is raised to a very high voltage as described in chapter viii this high tension current is sent into the184 aerial wire which quickly becomes charged up to its utmost limits but more current continues to arrive and so the electricity in the aerial unable to bear any longer the enormous pressure takes the only path of escape and bursts violently across the air gap separating the brass balls surging oscillations are then produced in the aerial the ether is violently disturbed and electric waves are set in motion this is the transmitting part of the apparatus ',\n",
       " 'if a stone is dropped into a pond little waves are set in185 motion and these spread outwards in ever widening rings electric waves also are propagated outwards in widening rings but instead of travelling in one plane only like the water waves they proceed in every plane and when they arrive at the receiving aerial they set up in it oscillations of the same nature as those which produced the waves let us suppose electric waves to reach the aerial wire of fig 33b the resistance of the coherer h is at once lowered so that current from battery n flows and operates the relay f which closes the circuit of battery m this battery has a twofold task it operates the sounder e and it energizes the electro magnet of the de coherer k as shown by the dotted lines this de coherer is simply an electric bell without the gong arranged so that the hammer strikes the coherer tube and its purpose is to tap the tube automatically and much more rapidly than is possible by hand the sounder therefore gives a click and the de coherer taps the tube restoring the resistance of the filings the circuit of battery n is then broken and the relay therefore interrupts the circuit of battery m if waves continue to arrive the circuits are again closed another click is given and again the hammer taps the tube as long as waves are falling upon the aerial the alternate makings and breakings of the circuits follow one another very rapidly and the sounder goes on working when the waves cease the hammer of the de coherer has the last word and the circuits of both batteries remain broken to confine the electric waves to their proper sphere two coils of wire ll called choking coils are inserted as shown ',\n",
       " 'in this simple apparatus we have all the really essential features of a wireless installation for short distances for long distance work various modifications are necessary but the principle remains exactly the same in land wireless186 stations the single vertical aerial wire becomes an elaborate arrangement of wires carried on huge masts and towers the distance over which signals can be transmitted and received depends to a considerable extent upon the height of the aerial and consequently land stations have the supporting masts or towers from one to several hundred feet in height according to the range over which it is desired to work as a rule the same aerial is used both for transmitting and receiving but some stations have a separate aerial for each purpose a good idea of the appearance of commercial aerials for long distance working may be obtained from the frontispiece which shows the marconi station at glace bay nova scotia from which wireless communication is held with the marconi station at clifden in galway ireland ',\n",
       " 'in the first wireless stations what is called a plain aerial transmitter was used and this was almost the same as the transmitting apparatus in fig 33a except of course that it was on a larger scale this arrangement had many serious drawbacks including that of a very limited range and it has been abandoned in favour of the coupled transmitter a sketch of which is shown in fig 34 in this transmitter there are two separate circuits having the same rate of oscillation a is an induction coil supplied with current from the battery b and c is a condenser a condenser is simply an apparatus for storing up charges of electricity it may take a variety of forms but in every case it must consist of two conducting layers separated by a non conducting layer the latter being called the dielectric the leyden jar is a condenser with conducting layers of tinfoil and a dielectric of glass but the condensers used for wireless purposes generally consist of a number of parallel sheets of metal separated by glass or mica or in some cases by air only the induction coil187 charges up the condenser with high tension electricity until the pressure becomes so great that the electricity is discharged in the form of a spark between the brass balls of the spark gap d the accumulated electric energy in the condenser then surges violently backwards and forwards and by induction corresponding surgings are produced in the aerial circuit these latter surgings setting up electric waves in the ether ',\n",
       " 'for the sake of simplicity we have represented the apparatus as using an induction coil but in all stations of any size the coil is replaced by a step up transformer and188 the current is supplied either from an electric light power station at some town near by or from a power house specially built for the purpose alternating current is generally used and if the current supplied is continuous it is converted into alternating current this may be done by making the continuous current drive an electric motor which in turn drives a dynamo generating alternating current in any case the original current is too low in voltage to be used directly but in passing through the transformer it is raised to the required high pressure the transmitting key which is inserted between the dynamo and the transformer is specially constructed to prevent the operator from receiving accidental shocks and the spark gap is enclosed in a sort of sound proof box to deaden the miniature thunders of the discharge ',\n",
       " 'during the time that signals are being transmitted sparks follow one another across the spark gap in rapid succession a thousand sparks per second being by no means an uncommon rate the violence of these rapid discharges raises the brass balls of the gap to a great heat this has the effect of making the sparking spasmodic and uncertain with the result that the signals at the receiving station are unsatisfactory to get over this difficulty marconi introduced a rotary spark gap this is a wheel with projecting knobs or studs mounted on the shaft of the dynamo supplying the current so that it rotates rapidly two stationary knobs are fixed so that the wheel rotates between them and the sparks are produced between these fixed knobs and those of the wheel a double spark gap thus being formed overheating is prevented by the currents of air set up by the rapid movement of the wheel and the sparking is always regular ',\n",
       " 'in the receiving apparatus already described a filings coherer was used to detect the ether waves and by means of a local battery to translate them into audible signals with a sounder or printed signals with a morse inker this coherer however is unsuitable for commercial working it is not sufficiently sensitive and it can be used only for comparatively short distances while its action is so slow that the maximum speed of signalling is not more than about seventeen or eighteen words a minute a number of different detectors of much greater speed and sensitiveness have been devised the most reliable of these though not the most sensitive is the marconi magnetic detector plate xiii b this consists of a moving band made of several soft iron wires twisted together and passing close to the poles of two horse shoe magnets as the band passes from the influence of one magnet to that of the other its magnetism becomes reversed but the change takes a certain amount of time to complete owing to the fact that the iron has some magnetic retaining power so that it resists slightly the efforts of one magnet to reverse the effect of the other the moving band passes through two small coils of wire one connected with the aerial and the other with a specially sensitive telephone receiver when the electric waves from the transmitting station fall upon the aerial of the receiving station small rapidly oscillating currents pass through the first coil and these have the effect of making the band reverse its magnetism instantly the sudden moving of the lines of magnetic force induces a current in the second coil and produces a click in the telephone as long as the waves continue the clicks follow one another rapidly and they are broken up into the long and short signals of the morse code according to the manipulation of the morse key at the sending station except for winding up at intervals the clockwork mechanism which drives the moving band this detector requires no attention and it is always ready for work ',\n",
       " '190',\n",
       " 'another form of detector makes use of the peculiar power possessed by certain crystals to rectify the oscillatory currents received from the aerial converting them into uni directional currents at every discharge of the condenser at the sending station a number of complete waves forming what is called a train of waves is set in motion from each train of waves the crystal detector produces one uni directional pulsation of current and this causes a click in the telephone receiver if these single pulsations follow one another rapidly and regularly a musical note is heard in the receiver various combinations of crystals and crystals and metal points are used but all work in the same way some combinations work without assistance but others require to have a small current passed through them from a local battery the crystals are held in small cups of brass or copper mounted so that they can be adjusted by means of set screws crystal detectors are extremely sensitive but they require very accurate adjustment and any vibration quickly throws them out of order ',\n",
       " 'the electrolytic detector rectifies the oscillating currents in a different manner one form consists of a thin platinum wire passing down into a vessel made of lead and containing a weak solution of sulphuric acid the two terminals of a battery are connected to the wire and the vessel respectively as long as no oscillations are received from the aerial the current is unable to flow between the wire and the vessel but when the oscillations reach the detector the current at once passes and operates the telephone receiver the action of this detector is not thoroughly understood and the way in which the point of the platinum wire prevents the passing of the current until the oscillations arrive from the aerial is something of a mystery ',\n",
       " 'the last detector that need be described is the fleming191 valve receiver this consists of an electric incandescent lamp with either carbon or tungsten filament into which is sealed a plate of platinum connected with a terminal outside the lamp the plate and the filament do not touch one another but when the lamp is lighted up a current can be passed from the plate to the filament but not from filament to plate this receiver acts in a similar way to the crystal detector making the oscillating currents into uni directional currents it has proved a great success for transatlantic wireless communication between the marconi stations at clifden and glace bay and is extensively used ',\n",
       " 'the electric waves set in motion by the transmitting apparatus of a wireless station spread outwards through the ether in all directions and so instead of reaching only the aerial of the particular station with which it is desired to communicate they affect the aerials of all stations within a certain range so long as only one station is sending messages this causes no trouble but when as is actually the case large numbers of stations are hard at work transmitting different messages at the same time it is evident that unless something can be done to prevent it each of these messages will be received at the same moment by every station within range thus producing a hopeless confusion of signals from which not a single message can be read fortunately this chaos can be avoided by what is called tuning ',\n",
       " 'wireless tuning consists in adjusting the aerial of the receiving station so that it has the same natural rate of oscillation as that of the transmitting station a simple experiment will make clearer the meaning of this if we strike a tuning fork so that it sounds its note and while it is sounding strongly place near it another fork of the same pitch and one of a different pitch we find that the fork of similar pitch also begins to sound faintly whereas the third192 fork remains silent the explanation is that the two forks of similar pitch have the same natural rate of vibration while the other fork vibrates at a different rate when the first fork is struck it vibrates at a certain rate and sets in motion air waves of a certain length these waves reach both the other forks but their effect is different in each case on reaching the fork of similar pitch the first wave sets it vibrating but not sufficiently to give out a sound but following this wave come others and as the fork has the same rate of vibration as the fork which produced the waves each wave arrives just at the right moment to add its impulse to that of the preceding wave so that the effect accumulates and the fork sounds in the case of the third fork of different pitch the first wave sets it also vibrating but as this fork cannot vibrate at the same rate as the one producing the waves the latter arrive at wrong intervals and instead of adding together their impulses they interfere with one another each upsetting the work of the one before it and the fork does not sound the same thing may be illustrated with a pendulum if we give a pendulum a gentle push at intervals corresponding to its natural rate of swing the effects of all these pushes are added together and the pendulum is made to swing vigorously if on the other hand we give the pushes at longer or shorter intervals they will not correspond with the pendulum s rate of swing so that while some pushes will help the pendulum others will hinder it and the final result will be that the pendulum is brought almost to a standstill instead of being made to swing strongly and regularly the same principle holds good with wireless aerials any aerial will respond readily to all other aerials having the same rate of oscillation because the waves in each case are of the same length that is to say they follow one another at the same intervals on the other hand an193 aerial will not respond readily to waves from another aerial having a different rate of oscillation because these do not follow each other at intervals to suit it ',\n",
       " 'if each station could receive signals only from stations having aerials similar to its own its usefulness would be very limited and so all stations are provided with means of altering the rate of oscillation of their aerials the actual tuning apparatus by which this is accomplished need not be described as it is complicated but what happens in practice is this the operator wearing telephone receivers fixed over his ears by means of a head band sits at a desk upon which are placed his various instruments he adjusts the tuning apparatus to a position in which signals from stations of widely different wave lengths are received fairly well and keeps a general look out over passing signals presently he hears his own call signal and knows that some station wishes to communicate with him immediately he alters the adjustment of his tuner until his aerial responds freely to the waves from this station but not to waves from other stations and in this way he is able to cut out signals from other stations and to listen to the message without interruption ',\n",
       " 'unfortunately wireless tuning is yet far from perfect in certain respects for instance if two stations are transmitting at the same time on the same wave length it is clearly impossible for a receiving operator to cut one out by wave tuning and to listen to the other only in such a case however it generally happens that although the wave frequency is the same the frequency of the wave groups or trains is different so that there is a difference in the notes heard in the telephones and a skilful operator can distinguish between the two sufficiently well to read whichever message is intended for him the stations which produce a clear medium pitched note are the easiest194 to receive from and in many cases it is possible to identify a station at once by its characteristic note tuning is also unable to prevent signals from a powerful station close at hand from swamping to some extent signals from another station at a great distance the nearer station making the receiving aerial respond to it as it were by brute force tuning or no tuning ',\n",
       " 'another source of trouble lies in interference by atmospheric electricity thunderstorms especially in the tropics interfere greatly with the reception of signals the lightning discharges giving rise to violent irregular groups of waves which produce loud noises in the telephones there are also silent electrical disturbances in the atmosphere and these too produce less strong but equally weird effects atmospheric discharges are very irregular without any real wave length so that an operator cannot cut them out by wave tuning pure and simple in the way just described as they defy him by affecting equally all adjustments fortunately the irregularity of the atmospherics produces correspondingly irregular sounds in the telephones quite unlike the clear steady note of a wireless station and unless the atmospherics are unusually strong this note pierces through them so that the signals can be read the effects of lightning discharges are too violent to be got rid of satisfactorily and practically all that can be done is to reduce the loudness of the noises in the telephones so that the operator is not temporarily deafened during violent storms in the near neighbourhood of a station it is usual to connect the aerial directly to earth so that in the event of its being struck by a flash the electricity passes harmlessly away instead of injuring the instruments and possibly also the operators marconi stations are always fitted with lightning arresters ',\n",
       " 'the methods and apparatus we have described so far195 are those of the marconi system and although in practice additional complicated and delicate pieces of apparatus are used the description given represents the main features of the system although marconi was not the discoverer of the principles of wireless telegraphy he was the first to produce a practical working system in 1896 marconi came from italy to england bringing with him his apparatus and after a number of successful demonstrations of its working he succeeded in convincing even the most sceptical experts that his system was thoroughly sound commencing with a distance of about 100 yards marconi rapidly increased the range of his experiments and by the end of 1897 he succeeded in transmitting signals from alum bay in the isle of wight to a steamer 18 miles away in 1899 messages were exchanged between british warships 85 miles apart and the crowning achievement was reached in 1901 when marconi received readable signals at st john s newfoundland from poldhu in cornwall a distance of about 1800 miles in 1907 the marconi stations at clifden and glace bay were opened for public service and by the following year transatlantic wireless communication was in full swing the sending of wireless signals across the atlantic was a remarkable accomplishment but it did not represent by any means the limits of the system as was shown in 1910 in that year marconi sailed for buenos ayres and wireless communication with clifden was maintained up to the almost incredible distance of 4000 miles by day and 6735 miles by night the marconi system has had many formidable rivals but it still holds the proud position of the most successful commercial wireless system in the world ',\n",
       " 'we have not space to give a description of the other commercial systems but a few words on some of the chief points in which they differ from the marconi system may196 be of interest we have seen that an ordinary spark gap formed by two metal balls a short distance apart becomes overheated by the rapid succession of discharges with the result that the sparking is irregular what actually happens is that the violent discharge tears off and vaporizes minute particles of the metal this intensely heated vapour forms a conducting path which the current is able to cross so that an arc is produced just in the same way as in the arc lamp this arc is liable to be formed by each discharge and it lasts long enough to prevent the sparks from following one another promptly in the marconi system this trouble is avoided by means of a rotating spark gap but in the german telefunken system so named from greek tele far off and german funke a spark a fixed compound spark gap is used for the same purpose this consists of a row of metal discs about 1 100 inch apart and the spark leaps these tiny gaps one after the other the discs are about 3 inches in diameter and their effect is to conduct away quickly the heat of the discharge by this means the formation of an arc is prevented and the effect of each discharge is over immediately the sparks being said to be quenched the short discharges enable more energy to be radiated from the aerial into the ether and very high rates of sparking are obtained producing a high pitched musical note ',\n",
       " 'the lepel system also uses a quenched spark the gap consists of two metal discs clamped together and separated only by a sheet of paper the paper has a hole through its centre and through this hole the discharge takes place the discs being kept cool by water in constant circulation the discharge is much less noisy than in the marconi and telefunken systems and the musical note produced is so sensitive that by varying the adjustments197 simple tunes can be played and these can be heard quite distinctly in the telephone at the receiving stations ',\n",
       " 'in the three systems already mentioned spark discharges are used to set up oscillatory currents in the aerial which in turn set up waves in the ether each discharge sets in motion a certain number of waves forming what is known as a train of waves the discharges follow one another very rapidly but still there is a minute interval between them and consequently there is a corresponding interval between the wave trains in the goldschmidt system the waves are not sent out in groups of this kind but in one long continuous stream the oscillatory currents which produce ether waves are really alternating currents which flow backwards and forwards at an enormous speed the alternating current produced at an ordinary power station is of no use for wireless purposes because its frequency or rate of flow backwards and forwards is far too low it has been found possible however to construct special dynamos capable of producing alternating current of the necessary high frequency and such dynamos are used in the goldschmidt system the dynamos are connected directly to the aerial so that the oscillatory currents in the latter are continuous and the ether waves produced are continuous also ',\n",
       " 'the poulsen system produces continuous waves in an altogether different manner by means of the electric arc the arc is formed between a fixed copper electrode and a carbon electrode kept in constant rotation and it is enclosed in a kind of box filled with methylated spirit vapour hydrogen or coal gas a powerful electro magnet is placed close to the arc so that the latter is surrounded by a strong magnetic field connected with the terminals of the arc is a circuit consisting of a condenser and a coil198 of wire and the arc sets up in this circuit oscillatory currents which are communicated to the aerial these currents are continuous and so also are the resulting waves ',\n",
       " 'the method of signalling employed in these two continuous wave systems is quite different from that used in the marconi and other spark systems it is practically impossible to signal by starting and stopping the alternating current dynamos or the arc at long or short intervals to represent dashes or dots in one case the sudden changes from full load to zero would cause the dynamo to vary its speed and consequently the wave length would be irregular besides which the dynamo would be injured by the sudden strains in the other case it would be extremely difficult to persuade the arc to start promptly each time on this account the dynamo and the arc are kept going continuously while a message is being transmitted and the signals are given by altering the wave length in other words the transmitting aerial is thrown in and out of tune alternately at the required long or short intervals and the receiving aerial responds only during the in tune intervals ',\n",
       " 'the various receiving detectors previously described are arranged to work with dis continuous waves producing a separate current impulse from each group or train of waves in continuous wave systems there are of course no separate groups and for this reason these detectors are of no use and a different arrangement is required the oscillatory currents set up in the aerial are allowed to charge up a condenser and this condenser is automatically disconnected from the aerial and connected to the operator s telephones at regular intervals of about 1 1000 second each time the condenser is connected to the telephones it is discharged and a click is produced these clicks199 continue only as long as the waves are striking the aerial and as the transmitting operator interrupts the waves at long or short intervals the clicks are split up into groups of corresponding length ',\n",
       " 'continuous waves have certain advantages over dis continuous waves particularly in the matter of sharp tuning but these advantages are outweighed to a large extent by weak points in the transmitting apparatus the dynamos used to produce the high frequency currents in the goldschmidt system are very expensive to construct and troublesome to keep in order while in the poulsen system the arc is difficult to keep going for long periods and it is liable to fluctuations which greatly affect its working power although all the commercial marconi installations make use of dis continuous waves exclusively mr marconi is still carrying out experiments with continuous waves ',\n",
       " 'there are many points in wireless telegraphy yet to be explained satisfactorily our knowledge of the electric ether waves is still limited and we do not know for certain how these waves travel from place to place or exactly what happens to them on their journeys for this reason we are unable to give a satisfactory explanation of the curious fact that generally speaking it is easier to signal over long distances at night than during the day still more peculiar is the fact that it is easier to signal in a north and south direction than in an east and west direction there are also remarkable variations in the strength of the signals at certain times particularly about sunset and sunrise every station has a certain normal range which does not vary much as a rule but at odd times astonishing freak distances are covered stations having for a short time ranges far beyond their usual limits these and other problems are being attacked by many200 investigators and no doubt before very long they will be solved wireless telegraphy already has reached remarkable perfection but it is still a young science and we may confidently expect developments which will enable us to send messages with all speed across vast gulfs of distance at present unconquered ',\n",
       " 'wireless telephony like wireless telegraphy makes use of electric waves set up in and transmitted through the ether the apparatus is practically the same in each case except in one or two important points in wireless telegraphy either continuous or dis continuous waves may be used and in the latter case the spark frequency may be as low as twenty five per second on the other hand wireless telephony requires waves which are either continuous or if dis continuous produced by a spark frequency of not less than 20 000 per second in other words the frequency of the wave trains must be well above the limits of audibility although dis continuous waves of a frequency of from 20 000 to 40 000 or more per second can be used it has been found more convenient to use absolutely continuous waves for wireless telephony and these may be produced by the marconi disc generator by the goldschmidt alternator or by the poulsen arc the last named being largely employed ',\n",

       " 'when exceptionally irregular surfaces have to be plated it is sometimes necessary to employ an anode of special shape in order to keep as uniform a distance as possible between the electrodes if this is not done those parts of the surface nearest the anode get more than their share of the current and so they receive a thicker deposit than the parts farther away ',\n",
       " 'an interesting process is that known as parcel plating by which decorative coatings of different coloured metals can be deposited on one article for instance if it is219 desired to have gold flowers on a silver brooch the parts which are not to be gilded are painted over with a non conducting varnish when this varnish is quite dry the brooch is placed in the gilding vat and the current sent through in the usual way the gold is then deposited only on the parts unprotected by varnish and after the gilding the varnish is easily removed by softening it in turpentine and brushing with a bristle brush more elaborate combinations of different coloured metals can be made in the same way ',\n",

       " 'the time occupied in plating is greatly shortened by stirring or agitating the solutions this sets up a good circulation of the liquid and a continual supply of fresh solution is brought to the cathode at the same time the resistance to the current is decreased and more current may be used without fear of burning fig 37 shows an arrangement for this purpose the solution is agitated by compressed air and at the same time the cathode rods are moved backwards and forwards plating solutions are also frequently heated in order to hasten the rate of deposition ',\n",

       " 'wireless telegraphy was systematically employed in land warfare for the first time in the balkan war during which it proved most useful both to the allies and to the turks one of the most interesting features of the war280 was the way in which wireless communication was kept up between the beleaguered city of adrianople and the turkish capital some time before war broke out the turkish government sent a portable marconi wireless set to adrianople and this was set up at a little distance from the city when war was declared the apparatus was brought inside the city walls and erected upon a small hill then came the siege for 153 days shukri pasha kept the turkish flag flying but the stubborn defence was broken down in the end through hunger and disease all through these weary days the little wireless set did its duty unfalteringly and by its aid regular communication was maintained with the government station at ok meidan just outside constantinople 130 miles away altogether about half a million words were transmitted from adrianople to the turkish capital ',\n",
       " 'the rapid development of aviation during the past few years has drawn attention to the necessity for some means of communication between the land and airships and aeroplanes in flight at first sight it might appear that wireless telegraphy could be used for this purpose without any trouble but experience has shown that there are certain difficulties in the way especially with regard to aeroplanes the chief difficulty with aeroplanes lies in the aerial this must take the form either of a long trailing wire or of fixed wires running between the planes and the tail a trailing wire is open to the objection that it is liable to get mixed up with the propeller besides which it appears likely to hamper to some slight extent the movements of a small and light machine a fixed aerial between planes and tail avoids these difficulties but on the other hand its wave length is bound to be inconveniently small the heavy and powerful british military aeroplanes apparently use a trailing wire of moderate length carried in a special manner so as to clear the propeller but few details are available at present a further trouble with aeroplanes lies in the tremendous noise made by the engine which frequently makes it quite impossible to hear incoming signals and the only way of getting over this difficulty appears to be for the operator to wear some sort of sound proof head gear signals have been transmitted from an aeroplane in flight up to distances of 40 or 50 miles quite successfully but the reception of signals by aeroplanes is not so satisfactory except for comparatively short distances although few particulars have been published regarding the work of the british aeroplanes in france it seems evident that wireless telegraphy is in regular use in addition to their value as scouts our aeroplanes appear to be extremely useful for the direction of heavy artillery fire using wireless to tell the gunners where each shell falls until the exact range is obtained in the case of airships the problem of wireless communication is much simpler a trailing wire presents no difficulties and on account of their great size much more powerful sets of apparatus can be carried the huge german zeppelin airships have a long freely floating aerial consisting of a wire which can be wound in or let out as required its full length being about 750 feet the total weight of the apparatus is nearly 300 lb and the transmitting range is said to be from about 120 to 200 miles ',\n",
       " 'electricity is used in the navy for a great variety of purposes besides telegraphy our battleships are lighted by electricity which is generated at a standard pressure of 220 volts this current is transformed down for the searchlights and also for the intricate systems of telephone alarm and firing circuits the magazines containing the deadly cordite are maintained at a constant temperature of 70 f by special refrigerating machinery driven by electricity 282 and the numerous fans for ventilating the different parts of the ship are also electrically driven electric power is used for capstans coaling winches sounding machines lifts pumps whether for drainage fire extinction or raising fresh water from the tanks and for the mechanism for operating boats and torpedo nets the mechanism for manipulating the great guns and their ammunition is hydraulic electricity was tried for this purpose on the battle cruiser invincible but was abandoned in favour of hydraulic power but though electricity is apparently out of favour in this department it takes an extremely important share in the work of controlling and firing the guns its duties being such as could not be carried out by hydraulic power ',\n",
       " 'the guns are controlled and fired from what is known as the fire control room which is situated in the interior of the ship quite away from the guns themselves the range finder from his perch up in the gigantic mast watches an enemy warship as she looms on the horizon and when she comes within range he estimates her distance by means of instruments of wonderful precision he then telephones to the fire control room giving this distance and also the enemy s speed and course the officer in charge of the fire control room calculates the elevation of the gun required for this distance and decides upon the instant at which the gun must be fired a telephoned order goes to the gun turret and the guns are brought to bear upon the enemy laid at the required elevation and sighted at the correct instant the fire control officer switches on an electric current to the gun which fires a small quantity of highly explosive material and this in turn fires the main charge of cordite the effect of the shell is watched intently from the fire control top up above the range finder and if as is very likely this first shell falls short of or overshoots the mark an estimate of the283 amount of error is communicated to the fire control room due corrections are then made the gun is laid at a slightly different elevation and this time the shell finds its mark with unerring accuracy ',\n",
       " 'the range of movement horizontal and vertical of modern naval guns is so great that it is possible for two guns to be in such relative positions that the firing of one would damage the other to guard against a disaster of this kind fixed stops are used supplemented by ingenious automatic alarms the alarm begins to sound as soon as any gun passes into a position in which it could damage another gun and it goes on sounding until the latter gun is moved out of the danger line ',\n",
       " 'since the outbreak of war the subject of submarine mines has been brought to our notice in very forcible fashion contrary to the general impression the explosive submarine mine is not a recent introduction it is difficult to say exactly when mines were first brought into use but at any rate we know that they were employed by russia during the crimean war apparently with little success the first really successful use of mines occurred in the american civil war when the confederates sank a number of vessels by means of them this practical demonstration of their possibilities did not pass unnoticed by european nations and in the franco german war we find that mines were used for harbour defence by both belligerents it is doubtful whether either nation derived much benefit from its mines and indeed as the war progressed germany found that the principal result of her mining operations was to render her harbours difficult and dangerous to her own shipping much greater success attended the use of mines in the russo japanese war but all previous records shrink into insignificance when compared with the destruction wrought by mines in the present great conflict ',\n",

       " 'submarine mines may be divided into two classes those for harbour defence and those for use in the open sea harbour defence mines are almost invariably electrically controlled that is they are connected with the shore by means of a cable and fired by an electric impulse sent along that cable in one system of control the moment of firing is determined entirely by observers on shore who aided by special optical instruments are able to tell exactly when a vessel is above any particular mine the actual firing is carried out by depressing a key which completes an electric circuit thus sending a current along the cable to actuate the exploding mechanism inside the mine a hostile ship therefore would be blown up on arriving at the critical position while a friendly vessel would be allowed to pass on in safety in this system of control there is no contact between the vessel and the mine the latter being well submerged or resting on the sea floor so that the harbour is not obstructed in any way this is a great advantage but against it must be set possible failure of the defence at a critical moment owing to thick weather which of course interferes seriously with the careful observation of the mine field necessary for accurate timing of the explosions this difficulty may be surmounted by a contact system of firing in this case the mines are placed so near the surface as to make contact with vessels passing over them the observers on shore are informed of the contact by means of an electric impulse automatically transmitted along the cable so that they are independent of continuous visual observation of the mined area as in the previous system the observers give the actual firing impulse the drawback to this method is the necessity for special pilotage arrangements for friendly ships in order to avoid unnecessary striking of the mines which are liable to have their mechanism deranged by constant blows if the harbour or285 channel can be closed entirely to friendly shipping the observers may be dispensed with their place being taken by automatic electric apparatus which fires at once any mine struck by a vessel ',\n",
       " 'shore controlled mines are excellent for harbour defence and a carefully distributed mine field backed by heavy fort guns presents to hostile vessels a barrier which may be regarded as almost impenetrable a strong fleet might conceivably force its way through but in so doing it would sustain tremendous losses and as these losses would be quite out of proportion to any probable gains such an attempt is not likely to be made except as a last resort ',\n",
       " 'for use in the open sea a different type of mine is required this must be quite self contained and automatic in action exploding when struck by a passing vessel the exploding mechanism may take different forms the blow given by a ship may be made to withdraw a pin thus releasing a sort of plunger which actuated by a powerful spring detonates the charge a similar result is obtained by the use of a suspended weight in place of plunger and spring still another form of mine is fired electrically by means of a battery the circuit of which is closed automatically by the percussion deep sea mines may be anchored or floating free free mines are particularly dangerous on account of the impossibility of knowing where they may be at any given moment they are liable to drift for considerable distances and to pass into neutral seas and to safeguard neutral shipping international rules require them to have some sort of clockwork mechanism which renders them harmless after a period of one hour it is quite certain that some at least of the german free mines have no such mechanism so that neutral shipping is greatly endangered ',\n",
       " 'submarine mines are known as ground mines or286 buoyant mines according to whether they rest on the sea bottom or float below the surface ground mines are generally made in the form of a cylinder buoyant mines being usually spherical the cases are made of steel and buoyancy is given when required by enclosing air spaces open sea mines are laid by special vessels mostly old cruisers the stern of these ships is partly cut away and the mines are run along rails to the stern and so overboard the explosive employed is generally gun cotton fired by a detonator charges up to 500 lb or more being used according to the depth of submersion and the horizontal distance at which the mine is desired to be effective ground mines can be used only in shallow water and even then they require a heavier charge than mines floating near the surface mines must not be laid too close together as the explosion of one might damage others the distance apart at which they are placed depends upon the amount of charge 500 lb mines requiring to be about 300 feet apart for safety ',\n",
       " 'the question which heads this our final chapter is one which must occur to every one who takes even the most casual interest in matters scientific and it would be very satisfactory if we could bring this volume to a conclusion by providing a full and complete answer unfortunately this is impossible in years to come the tireless labours of scientific investigators may lead to a solution of the problem but as professor fleming puts it the question what is electricity no more admits of a complete and final answer to day than does the question what is life ',\n",
       " 'from the earliest days of electrical science theories of electricity have been put forward the gradual extension and development of these theories and the constant substitution of one idea for another as experimental data increased provide a fascinating subject for study to cover this ground however even in outline would necessitate many chapters and so it will be better to consider only the theory which with certain reservations in some cases is held by the scientific world of to day this is known as the electron theory of electricity ',\n",
       " 'we have referred already in chapter xxiv to atoms and electrons all matter is believed to be constituted of minute particles called atoms these atoms are so extremely small that they are quite invisible being far beyond the range of the most powerful microscope and their diameter has been estimated at somewhere about one288 millionth of a millimetre up to a few years ago the atom was believed to be quite indivisible but it has been proved beyond doubt that this is not the case an atom may be said to consist of two parts one much larger than the other the smaller part is negatively electrified and is the same in all atoms while the larger part is positively electrified and varies according to the nature of the atom the small negatively electrified portion of the atom consists of particles called electrons and these electrons are believed to be indivisible units or atoms of negative electricity to quote professor fleming an atom of matter in its neutral condition has been assumed to consist of an outer shell or envelope of negative electrons associated with some core or matrix which has an opposite electrical quality such that if an electron is withdrawn from the atom the latter is left positively electrified ',\n",
       " 'the electrons in an atom are not fixed but move with great velocity in definite orbits they repel one another and are constantly endeavouring to fly away from the atom but they are held in by the attraction of the positive core so long as nothing occurs to upset the constitution of the atom a state of equilibrium is maintained and the atom is electrically neutral but immediately the atom is broken up by the action of an external force of some kind one or more electrons break their bonds and fly away to join some other atom an atom which has lost some of its electrons is no longer neutral but is electro positive and similarly an atom which has gained additional electrons is electro negative electrons or atoms of negative electricity can be isolated from atoms of matter as in the case of the stream of electrons proceeding from the cathode of a vacuum tube so far however it has been found impossible to isolate corresponding atoms of positive electricity ',\n",
       " 'from these facts it appears that we must regard a289 positively charged body as possessing a deficiency of electrons and a negatively charged body as possessing an excess of electrons in chapter i we spoke of the electrification of sealing wax or glass rods by friction and we saw that according to the nature of the substance used as the rubber the rods were either positively or negatively electrified apparently when we rub a glass rod with a piece of silk the surface atoms of each substance are disturbed and a certain number of electrons leave the glass atoms and join the silk atoms the surface atoms of the glass previously neutral are now electro positive through the loss of electrons and the surface atoms of the silk also previously neutral are now electro negative through the additional electrons received from the glass atoms as the result we find the glass to be positively and silk to be negatively electrified on the other hand if we rub the glass with fur a similar atomic disturbance and consequent migration of electrons takes place but this time the glass receives electrons instead of parting with them in this case the glass becomes negatively and the fur positively electrified the question now arises why is the movement of the electrons away from the glass in the first instance and toward it in the second to understand this we may make use of a simple analogy if we place in contact two bodies one hot and the other cold the hot body gives up some of its heat to the cold body but if we place in contact with the hot body another body which is still hotter then the hot body receives heat instead of parting with it in a somewhat similar manner an atom is able to give some of its electrons to another atom which in comparison with it is deficient in electrons and at the same time it is able to receive electrons from another atom which compared with it has an excess of electrons thus we may assume that the glass atoms have an excess of electrons as compared with290 silk atoms and a deficiency in electrons as compared with fur atoms ',\n",
       " 'a current of electricity is believed to be nothing more or less than a stream of electrons set in motion by the application of an electro motive force we have seen that some substances are good conductors of electricity while others are bad conductors or non conductors in order to produce an electric current that is a current of electrons it is evidently necessary that the electrons should be free to move in good conductors which are mostly metals it is believed that the electrons are able to move from atom to atom without much hindrance while in a non conductor their movements are hampered to such an extent that inter atomic exchange of electrons is almost impossible speaking on this point professor fleming says there may be in a good conductor a constant decomposition and recomposition of atoms taking place and any given electron so to speak flits about now forming part of one atom and now of another and anon enjoying a free existence it resembles a person visiting from house to house forming a unit in different households and in between being a solitary person in the street in non conductors on the other hand the electrons are much restricted in their movements and can be displaced a little way but are pulled back again when released ',\n",
       " 'let us try to see now how an electric current is set up in a simple voltaic cell consisting of a zinc plate and a copper plate immersed in dilute acid first we must understand the meaning of the word ion if we place a small quantity of salt in a vessel containing water the salt dissolves and the water becomes salt not only at the bottom where the salt was placed but throughout the whole vessel this means that the particles of salt must be able to move through the water salt is a chemical291 compound of sodium and chlorine and its molecules consist of atoms of both these substances it is supposed that each salt molecule breaks up into two parts one part being a sodium atom and the other a chlorine atom and further that the sodium atom loses an electron while the chlorine atom gains one these atoms have the power of travelling about through the solution and they are called ions which means wanderers an ordinary atom is unable to wander about in this way but it gains travelling power as soon as it is converted into an ion by losing electrons if it be an atom of a metal and by gaining electrons if it be an atom of a non metal ',\n",
       " 'returning to the voltaic cell we may imagine that the atoms of the zinc which are immersed in the acid are trying to turn themselves into ions so that they can travel through the solution in order to do this each atom parts with two electrons and these electrons try to attach themselves to the next atom this atom however already has two electrons and so in order to accept the newcomers it must pass on its own two in this way electrons are passed on from atom to atom of the zinc then along the connecting wire and so to the copper plate the atoms of zinc which have lost their electrons thus become ions with power of movement they leave the zinc plate immediately and so the plate wastes away or dissolves so we get a constant stream of electrons travelling along the wire connecting the two plates and this constitutes an electric current ',\n",
       " 'the electron theory gives us also a clear conception of magnetism an electric current flowing along a wire produces magnetic effects that is it sets up a field of magnetic force such a current is a stream of electrons and therefore we conclude that a magnetic field is produced by electrons in motion this being so we are led to suppose that there must be a stream of electrons in a steel292 magnet and this stream must be constant because the magnetic field of such a magnet is permanent the electron stream in a permanent magnet however is not quite the same as the electron stream in a wire conveying a current we have stated that the electrons constituting an atom move in definite orbits so that we may picture them travelling round the core of the atom as the planets travel round the sun this movement is continuous in every atom of every substance apparently we have here the necessary conditions for the production of a magnetic field that is a constant stream of electrons but one important thing is still lacking in an unmagnetized piece of steel the atoms are not arranged symmetrically so that the orbits of their electrons lie some in one plane and some in another consequently although the electron stream of each atom undoubtedly produces an infinitesimally small magnetic field no magnetic effect that we can detect is produced because the different streams are not working in unison and adding together their forces in fact they are upsetting and neutralizing each other s efforts by stroking the piece of steel with a magnet or by surrounding it by a coil of wire conveying a current the atoms are turned so that their electron orbits all lie in the same plane the electron streams now all work in unison their magnetic effects are added together and we get a strong magnetic field as the result of their combined efforts any piece of steel or iron may be regarded as a potential magnet requiring only a rearrangement of its atoms in order to become an active magnet in chapter vi it was stated that other substances besides iron and steel show magnetic effects and this is what we should expect as the electron movement is common to all atoms none of these substances is equal to iron and steel in magnetic power but why this is so is not understood ',\n",
       " '293',\n",
       " 'this brings us to the production of an electric current by the dynamo here we have a coil of wire moving across a magnetic field alternately passing into this field and out of it a magnetic field is produced as we have just seen by the steady movement of electrons and we may picture it as being a region of the ether disturbed or strained by the effect of the moving electrons when the coil of wire passes into the magnetic field the electrons of its atoms are influenced powerfully and set in motion in one direction so producing a current in the coil as the coil passes away from the field its electrons receive a second impetus which checks their movement and starts them travelling in the opposite direction and another current is produced the coil moves continuously and regularly passing into and out of the magnetic field without interruption and so we get a current which reverses its direction at regular intervals that is an alternating current this current may be made continuous if desired as explained in chapter ix ',\n",
       " 'such stated briefly and in outline is the electron theory of electricity it opens up possibilities of the most fascinating nature it gives us a wonderfully clear conception of what might be called the inner mechanism of electricity and it even introduces us to the very atoms of electricity beyond this at present it cannot take us and the actual nature of electricity itself remains an enigma ']"
